# Using the Openlane API

## Using the GraphQL API

To use the GraphQL API, you can refer to the schema available in the [Openlane GraphQL Documentation](/docs/api/graph-api/queries). This schema provides detailed information about the types, queries, and mutations that you can use to interact with the Openlane API.

For an interactive experience, you can explore the GraphQL API using the [GraphQL Explorer](/graphql). This tool allows you to construct and test queries in real-time, making it easier to understand the capabilities of the API and how to use it effectively.

## Using the REST API

To use the REST API, you can refer to the endpoints available in the [Openlane REST API Documentation](docs/api/rest-api/openlane-openapi-3-1-0-specifications.info.mdx). This documentation provides detailed information about the available endpoints, request methods, parameters, and responses.

## Authentication

All Openlane APIs use token-based authentication. You need to include an `Authorization` header with your token in each request:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### Example Request

Here is an example of how to make a GET request to retrieve a list of resources using `curl`:

```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.theopenlane.io/v1/account/roles/organization -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
