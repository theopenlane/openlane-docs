It contains `Line1`, `Line2`, `City`, `State`, `PostalCode`, and `Country`

## Any

Any is a generic fallback type

## AssessmentMethod

The `AssessmentMethod` scalar type represents methods that can be used during the audit to assess the control implementation

## AssessmentObjective

The `AssessmentObjective` scalar type represents objectives that are validated during the audit to ensure the control is implemented

## Boolean

The `Boolean` scalar type represents `true` or `false`.

## Change

Change is a difference between two updates to an object used by
the audit history resolvers

## Channel

Channel notifications will be sent to including in-app, slack, etc

## CredentialSet

## DateTime

DateTime allows clients to use multiple time/date formats ( 2006-01-10 or 2025-04-28T04:00:00Z )

## EvidenceRequests

The EvidenceRequests scalar type that represents documents or artifacts that can be collected to demonstrate compliance with a control

## ExampleEvidence

The `ExampleEvidence` scalar type represents example evidence that can be used to satisfy the control

## ExportMetadata

ExportMetadata contains metadata for an export record

## Float

The `Float` scalar type represents signed double-precision fractional values as specified by [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point).

## ID

The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `"4"`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.

## ImplementationGuidance

The `ImplementationGuidance` scalar type that represents steps to take to implement a control; they can come directly from the control source or pulled from external sources

## Int

The `Int` scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.

## JobCadence

JobCadence is when a job should be scheduled to run

## JobConfiguration

JobConfiguration is the configuration for an automated job

## JSON

A valid JSON string.

## Map

The builtin Map type

## Price

The `Price` scalar type represents a monetary value for a subscription, including the numerical amount, the interval of recurrence and the currency to be charged in (e.g. USD)

## Reference

The `Reference` represents are links to external sources that can be used to gain more information about the control

## SSOAuthorizationMap

SSOAuthorizationMap is a map of organization IDs to SSO verification timestamps.
This scalar is used to track SSO verification times for organizations in the context of token authorization.

## String

The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.

## TestingProcedures

The TestingProcedures scalar type that represents steps to take to test a control; they can come directly from the control source or pulled from external sources

## Time

The builtin Time type

## Upload

The `Upload` scalar type represents a file upload.
This scalar is typically used to handle file uploads in GraphQL mutations.

## VersionBump

VersionBump allows a revision to automatically be bumped based on "Major", "Minor", "Patch", or "Draft"

## WorkflowAssignmentApproval

WorkflowAssignmentApproval captures structured metadata for workflow assignment approvals.

## WorkflowAssignmentInvalidation

WorkflowAssignmentInvalidation captures details when an approval is invalidated.

## WorkflowAssignmentRejection

WorkflowAssignmentRejection captures details when an approval is rejected or denied.

## WorkflowDefinitionDocument

WorkflowDefinitionDocument captures triggers, conditions, actions, and selectors that define a workflow.

## WorkflowDefinitionSchema

WorkflowDefinitionSchema is a JSON schema describing the shape of workflow definitions for validation.

## WorkflowEventPayload

WorkflowEventPayload stores payloads emitted by workflow events and actions.

## WorkflowInstanceContext

WorkflowInstanceContext contains runtime context for a workflow instance including assignments and object info.
