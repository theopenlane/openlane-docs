# Overview

A Risk Assessment is a process to identify potential hazards and analyze what could happen if a hazard occurs. A business impact analysis (BIA) is the process for determining the potential impacts resulting from the interruption of time-sensitive or critical business processes. It is important to perform a risk assessment to understand the potential risks to your business and to identify the measures that can be taken to mitigate those risks.

## Risk Assessment

Risk assessments should be actively taking place in the organization. This will include a subset of controls such as evaluating vendor risk and software vendors. In today's fast-paced business world security assessments often come in the form of a security questionnaire. Which is then evaluated by the business from a security perspective. Alternatively, businesses are also requesting attestation reports such as a SOC 2, or ISO 270001 report before deciding between vendors.  Monitoring activities come in the form of many different processes and procedures. However, with regards to SOC 2, there are two different types. Administrative, and technical. As we continue through this course you will start to see and notate the difference between administrative and technical controls.

## Risk Management

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings. These threats, or risks, could stem from a wide variety of sources, including financial uncertainty, legal liabilities, strategic management errors, accidents, and natural disasters.

## Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation is the process of taking steps to reduce adverse effects. This process can involve avoiding the risk, reducing the negative effect or probability of the risk, transferring all or part of the risk to another party, and retaining some or all of the consequences of a particular risk, usually by choice.

## Risk Monitoring

Risk monitoring is the process of tracking and evaluating risks over time. This process can involve identifying new risks, reassessing existing risks, and monitoring the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies. Risk monitoring is an essential part of risk management, as it helps organizations stay ahead of potential threats and respond quickly to changes in their risk environment.

## Risk Reporting

Risk reporting is the process of communicating information about risks to key stakeholders. This process can involve creating risk reports, presenting risk information to decision-makers, and ensuring that stakeholders have the information they need to make informed decisions. Risk reporting is an essential part of risk management, as it helps organizations identify and respond to risks effectively.

## Risk Analysis

Risk analysis is the process of identifying and assessing risks to an organization. This process can involve analyzing the likelihood and impact of risks, evaluating the effectiveness of existing risk controls, and identifying new risks that may emerge. Risk analysis is an essential part of risk management, as it helps organizations understand their risk exposure and develop strategies to mitigate potential threats.

## Risk Assessment Framework

A risk assessment framework is a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks. This framework can include tools, techniques, and methodologies for conducting risk assessments, as well as guidelines for documenting and reporting risk information. A risk assessment framework can help organizations standardize their risk management processes and ensure that risks are identified and addressed consistently across the organization.

## Risk Assessment Process

The risk assessment process involves several key steps, including identifying risks, analyzing risks, evaluating risks, and developing risk mitigation strategies. This process can be conducted at the organizational level, project level, or individual level, depending on the scope of the risk assessment. The risk assessment process is an essential part of risk management, as it helps organizations understand their risk exposure and develop strategies to protect against potential threats.
