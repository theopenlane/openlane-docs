# Import Existing Polices and Procedures

If you already have policies and procedures documented outside of Openlane you can import these into the platform using our bulk upload feature. This allows you to quickly get your existing documentation into Openlane without having to manually recreate each policy or procedure.

## Supported Formats

Currently we support the following document types for import:

- Markdown (.md, .mdx)
- Microsoft Word (.docx, .doc)
- Text files (.txt)


## Import through Console

To import your existing policies and procedures, follow these steps:

1. From the Openlane console, navigate to either the Policies or Procedures section, depending on what you want to import
1. Click the `...` menu and choose `Import existing document`
1. Select the file(s) you wish to import from your local machine. You can select multiple files at once and they will each be created as a separate policy or procedure
1. Click `Upload` to start the import process

:::tip
The object names will be derived from the file names, for example `access_control_policy.md` will create a policy named `Access Control Policy`. You can rename the objects after import if needed.
