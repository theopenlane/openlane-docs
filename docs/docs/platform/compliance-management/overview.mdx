#  Compliance Management Overview

Openlane provides a centralized platform for managing compliance requirements, policies, and procedures. Users can track compliance status, assign tasks, and generate reports to demonstrate adherence to regulatory standards. Grant auditor access directly to Openlane to save time uploading evidence to third-party platforms.

## Centralized Compliance Repository

This includes a wide range of documents such as regulatory requirements, internal policies, standard operating procedures, and industry best practices. By consolidating these resources into a single, easily accessible platform, Openlane eliminates the need for scattered documents and disparate systems.

The platform allows for the creation of customized compliance checklists and workflows, ensuring that all necessary steps are completed and documented. Users can track the progress of each task, identify potential bottlenecks, and receive automated alerts for upcoming deadlines or overdue items.
