# Job Management

Openlane provides comprehensive job management capabilities for automating compliance workflows, scheduling recurring tasks, and executing background processes. The job system consists of three main components: **Job Runners** for execution infrastructure, **Job Templates** for reusable job definitions, and **Scheduled Jobs** for automated execution.

## What is Job Management?

The job management system enables organizations to automate compliance activities, execute recurring tasks, and orchestrate complex workflows across the platform. It provides reliable, scalable infrastructure for background processing and task automation.

## Core Components

### Job Runners
Job Runners are execution environments that process jobs and tasks. They provide the compute infrastructure and runtime environment for job execution.

### Job Templates
Job Templates define reusable job configurations, parameters, and execution logic that can be instantiated for specific tasks.

### Scheduled Jobs
Scheduled Jobs automate the execution of job templates based on time-based triggers, events, or conditions.

## Key Features

- **Automated Workflows**: Execute complex compliance workflows automatically
- **Scheduling**: Time-based and event-based job scheduling
- **Scalability**: Distributed job execution across multiple runners
- **Monitoring**: Real-time job status tracking and logging
- **Templates**: Reusable job definitions for common tasks
- **Integration**: Native integration with platform objects and external systems

## Job Types

### Compliance Automation Jobs
- **Control Testing**: Automated control effectiveness testing
- **Evidence Collection**: Scheduled evidence gathering and validation
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated risk scoring and assessment updates
- **Audit Preparation**: Automated audit documentation and report generation

### Data Processing Jobs
- **Data Import/Export**: Bulk data processing and synchronization
- **Report Generation**: Scheduled compliance reports and dashboards
- **Data Validation**: Automated data quality checks and validation
- **Backup Operations**: Automated backup and archival processes

### Integration Jobs
- **Third-Party Sync**: Synchronization with external systems and APIs
- **Notification Delivery**: Automated alerts and communication delivery
- **System Monitoring**: Health checks and system status monitoring
- **Maintenance Tasks**: Routine system maintenance and cleanup


## Job Scheduling

### Cron Schedule Format
Scheduled jobs use standard cron syntax for time-based scheduling:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Common Schedule Examples
- `0 2 * * *` - Daily at 2:00 AM
- `0 3 * * 1` - Weekly on Monday at 3:00 AM
- `0 4 1 * *` - Monthly on the 1st at 4:00 AM
- `0 5 * * 1-5` - Weekdays at 5:00 AM
- `*/15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes

## Monitoring and Logging

### Job Status Tracking
- **QUEUED**: Job is waiting for execution
- **RUNNING**: Job is currently executing
- **COMPLETED**: Job completed successfully
- **FAILED**: Job execution failed
- **CANCELLED**: Job was cancelled before completion

### Job Execution Logs
All job executions generate detailed logs including:
- Start and end timestamps
- Execution parameters
- Progress indicators
- Error messages and stack traces
- Resource utilization metrics

### Alerting and Notifications
Configure alerts for:
- Job failures and errors
- Long-running job detection
- Resource utilization thresholds
- Schedule misses or delays
