# Control Implementations

Control Implementations represent the actual implementation status, details, and verification of security controls within an organization. They bridge the gap between theoretical control requirements and practical implementation.

## What Are Control Implementations?

Control Implementations are specific instances of how controls are actually implemented within an organization. They track the implementation status, provide detailed implementation information, and maintain verification records to demonstrate that controls are effectively operating.

## Compliance Significance

Control Implementations are essential for:

- **Implementation Tracking**: Monitoring the actual deployment of security controls
- **Verification Management**: Documenting testing and validation of control effectiveness
- **Audit Readiness**: Providing evidence of control implementation for auditors
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Tracking ongoing control operation and maintenance
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifying implementation gaps and remediation needs

## Implementation Status Types

### Draft Implementation

- **Status**: Initial planning and design phase
- **Activities**: Requirements analysis, design documentation, resource planning
- **Deliverables**: Implementation plan, design specifications, resource requirements
- **Next Steps**: Approval for implementation

### In Progress Implementation

- **Status**: Active implementation work underway
- **Activities**: System configuration, policy deployment, procedure implementation
- **Deliverables**: Partial implementation, progress reports, interim testing
- **Next Steps**: Complete implementation and initial testing

### Implemented

- **Status**: Implementation complete, control operational
- **Activities**: Full deployment, documentation completion, initial verification
- **Deliverables**: Implementation documentation, configuration evidence, operational procedures
- **Next Steps**: Formal verification and validation

### Verified

- **Status**: Implementation verified and validated as effective
- **Activities**: Formal testing, validation procedures, effectiveness assessment
- **Deliverables**: Verification report, test results, effectiveness evidence
- **Next Steps**: Ongoing monitoring and maintenance

## Properties

### Core Information

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the control implementation
- **Status**: Current implementation status (draft, in progress, implemented, verified)
- **Implementation Date**: When the control was implemented
- **Verified**: Boolean indicating if implementation has been verified
- **Verification Date**: When verification was completed

### Implementation Details
- **Details**: Comprehensive description of how the control is implemented
- **Implementation Method**: Approach used for implementation (manual, automated, hybrid)
- **Responsible Party**: Individual or team responsible for implementation
- **Implementation Evidence**: Supporting documentation and artifacts

### Verification and Testing
- **Verification Method**: How the control effectiveness is verified
- **Test Results**: Results from control testing and validation
- **Verification Evidence**: Evidence supporting control effectiveness
- **Last Verification**: Date of most recent verification

### Relationships
- **Control**: Parent control this implementation belongs to
- **Subcontrol**: Associated subcontrol if applicable
- **Organization**: Organization responsible for implementation
- **Assignee**: Person assigned to manage implementation
