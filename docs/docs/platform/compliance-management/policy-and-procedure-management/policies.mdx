# Overview

Policies and procedures are the foundation of any organization. They provide a framework for decision-making, guide behavior, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In the context of Openlane, policies and procedures are essential for managing risks, securing systems, and ensuring continuous compliance.

This section of the documentation provides an overview of policies and procedures within Openlane. It covers the policy lifecycle, best practices for creating policies, and how to enforce policies using technology. Whether you’re new to Openlane or looking to optimize your policy management processes, this documentation will help you get started.

## What are Policies and Procedures?

Policies and procedures are formal documents that outline the rules, guidelines, and standards that govern an organization’s operations. Policies define the organization’s goals and objectives, while procedures provide detailed instructions on how to achieve those goals. Together, policies and procedures help ensure consistency, accountability, and compliance across the organization.

- Ensure compliance with laws and regulations
- Protect sensitive information and data
- Promote a culture of accountability and transparency
- Improve operational efficiency and consistency
- Minimize risks and prevent security breaches
- Documents can inform employees about exactly what they need to do and who to report to in various situations
