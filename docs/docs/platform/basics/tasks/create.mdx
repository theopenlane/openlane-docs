# Create Task

You can create a new task directly from the OpenLane console by navigating to [tasks](https://console.theopenlane.io/tasks) and clicking the "Create Task" button. This allows you to specify all relevant details for the new task.

### Task Fields

When creating a task, you will be prompted to enter the following fields:

- **Title**: A brief, descriptive name for the task
- **Description**: Detailed information about what the task involves
- **Due Date**: The deadline by which the task should be completed.
- **Type**: Select the type of task, such as Evidence, Risk Review, Policy Review, or Other
- **Assignee**: The user responsible for completing the task
- **Associate Objects**: Link the task to related objects (such as controls or other entities) to maintain context and relationships

### Creating a Task from Other Screens

In addition to the main Tasks page, tasks can also be created from various other screens within the console, such as from a control or related object. When you create a task from another object (e.g., a control), the system will automatically link the new task to that object, streamlining your workflow and ensuring proper associations.

This feature helps maintain context and relationships between tasks and other entities in the system.


### Bulk Task Creation

For scenarios where multiple tasks need to be created at once, Openlane supports bulk task creation. This can be done by importing a CSV file containing the details of each task. To do this, navigate to the Tasks page and select the "Bulk Upload" option. Follow the prompts to upload your CSV file, ensuring that it adheres to the required format.

You can download a sample CSV template directly from the bulk upload interface to ensure your data is structured correctly and what fields are supported.

:::tip
    Refer to our API documentation for details on supported task fields in the [GraphQL object reference](/docs/api/graph-api/objects). When putting fields that are lists in the CSV, such as `Tags`, provide valid JSON like `[""soc2"", ""evidence""]` with double quotes escaped.

#### Example CSV Format

```csv
Title,Category,Due,Tags,Details,Status,
Evidence Request For CC-101,Evidence,2026-01-31T07:00:00Z,"[""other-documentation"", ""soc2""]",Software development life cycle methodology/policy and procedures,OPEN,
Evidence Request For CC-102,Evidence,2026-01-31T07:00:00Z,"[""other-documentation"", ""soc2""]",Evidence that the mission statement has been communicated to employees during onboarding and annually thereafter,OPEN,
Evidence Request For CC-103,Evidence,2026-01-31T07:00:00Z,"[""sample"", ""soc2""]",Evidence that data was disposed of in accordance with established policies for a selection of offboarded customers,OPEN,
```

The above will create three new tasks with the specified details, including title, category, due date, tags, details, and status.
