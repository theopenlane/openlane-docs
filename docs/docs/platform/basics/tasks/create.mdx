# Create Task

You can create a new task directly from the OpenLane console by navigating to [tasks](https://console.theopenlane.io/tasks) and clicking the "Create Task" button. This allows you to specify all relevant details for the new task.

### Task Fields

When creating a task, you will be prompted to enter the following fields:

- **Title**: A brief, descriptive name for the task
- **Description**: Detailed information about what the task involves
- **Due Date**: The deadline by which the task should be completed.
- **Type**: Select the type of task, such as Evidence, Risk Review, Policy Review, or Other
- **Assignee**: The user responsible for completing the task
- **Associate Objects**: Link the task to related objects (such as controls or other entities) to maintain context and relationships

### Creating a Task from Other Screens

In addition to the main Tasks page, tasks can also be created from various other screens within the console, such as from a control or related object. When you create a task from another object (e.g., a control), the system will automatically link the new task to that object, streamlining your workflow and ensuring proper associations.

This feature helps maintain context and relationships between tasks and other entities in the system.
