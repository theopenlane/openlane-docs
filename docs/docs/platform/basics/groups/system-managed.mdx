The system provides three special groups: **Viewers**, **Admins**, and **All Members**.

- **Viewers**: Contains all users with viewing permissions in the organization.
- **Admins**: Contains all users with administrative (read and write access) privileges in the organization.
- **All Members**: Contains every user in the organization.

## Key Characteristics
- **Automatic Membership**: Users are automatically added to these groups based on their roles and cannot be manually added or removed.
- **Non-Editable Membership**: Membership in these groups cannot be directly managed by users or administrators.
- **Permission Assignment**: These groups can be used to assign permissions to objects within the system, enabling streamlined access control.

> **Note:** Use these groups to efficiently manage permissions without the need to manually update group memberships.
