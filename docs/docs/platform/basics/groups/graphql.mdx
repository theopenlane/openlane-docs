## Query Groups
```graphql
query GetGroups($first: Int, $where: GroupWhereInput) {
  groups(first: $first, where: $where) {
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
      endCursor
    }
    totalCount
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        displayID
        description
        settings {
          visibility
          joinPolicy
        }
        members {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              user {
                id
                firstName
                lastName
                email
              }
              role
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Creating Groups

Groups can be created in several ways:

* Basic Creation: Using the `createGroup` mutation.
* With Members: Using the `createGroupWithMembers` mutation, which allows specifying members at the time of creation.
* By Cloning: Using the `createGroupByClone` mutation, which allows creating a new group by cloning the permissions and/or members of an existing group.

### Basic Group Creation Mutation

```graphql
mutation CreateGroup($input: CreateGroupInput!) {
  createGroup(input: $input) {
    group {
      id
      name
      displayName
      owner {
        id
        displayName
      }
      setting {
        id
        joinPolicy
        syncToGithub
        syncToSlack
        visibility
      }
      permissions {
        id
        objectType
        permissions
      }
      members {
        id
        role
        user {
          id
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Add Group Member
```graphql
mutation CreateGroupMembership($input: CreateGroupMembershipInput!) {
  createGroupMembership(input: $input) {
    groupMembership {
      id
      role
      user {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        email
      }
      group {
        id
        name
        displayID
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating Groups

Groups can be updated using the `updateGroup` mutation. This mutation allows modifying various attributes of the group, including its name, description, and settings. Additionally, it supports adding or removing members and inheriting permissions from another group.

### Update Group Mutation

```graphql
mutation UpdateGroup($id: ID!, $input: UpdateGroupInput!) {
  updateGroup(id: $id, input: $input) {
    group {
      id
      name
      displayName
      description
      setting {
        id
        joinPolicy
        syncToGithub
        syncToSlack
        visibility
      }
      permissions {
        id
        objectType
        permissions
      }
      members {
        id
        role
        user {
          id
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Permissions Management

**Use Case**: Create a Program where the user can view the program only but edit controls

1. Create a Program and Control Objects:
    1. Create a program object and a control object
    1. Add the member to the program with a role of member (viewer)
    1. Assign the user to groups as an editor or owner of the control

### Create a Program

```graphql
mutation CreateProgram($input: CreateProgramInput!) {
  createProgram(input: $input) {
    program {
      id
      name
      description
      status
      framework
      owner {
        id
        displayName
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Create a Control

```graphql
mutation CreateControl($input: CreateControlInput!) {
  createControl(input: $input) {
    control {
      id
      name
      description
      status
      owner {
        id
        displayName
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Assign Permissions

Add user as viewer of the program:

```graphql
mutation AssignViewerToProgram {
  updateProgram(id: "program1-id", input: {
    viewers: ["group-id"]
  }) {
    program {
      id
      name
      viewers {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add user as editor of control:

```graphql
mutation AssignEditorToControl {
  updateControl(id: "control1-id", input: {
    editors: ["group-id"]
  }) {
    control {
      id
      name
      editors {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Permission Inheritance

1. Group Membership:
    * A user is added as a member of a group
    * The group has editor permissions of a program
1. Inherited Permissions:
    * The user inherits editor permissions for the program through their membership in the group.

**Example**

Create a group:

```graphql
mutation CreateGroup {
  createGroup(input: {
    name: "Group1",
    description: "A sample group"
  }) {
    group {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Add user to group:

```graphql
mutation AddUserToGroup {
  updateGroup(id: "group1-id", input: {
    members: ["user1-id"]
  }) {
    group {
      id
      name
      members {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Assign group as editor of the program:

```graphql
mutation AssignEditorToProgram {
  updateProgram(id: "program1-id", input: {
    editors: ["group1-id"]
  }) {
    program {
      id
      name
      editors {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Permission Overlap

When a user is in multiple groups with different permissions for the same object, the most permissive set of permissions typically applies. In this case, if a user is in one group that can edit a program and another group that can only view the program, the user will have the higher level of access, which is the ability to edit the program.

**Example Scenario**:
    * **Group A**: Has editor permissions for `Program1`.
    * **Group B**: Has viewer permissions for `Program1`.
    * **User1**: Is a member of both `Group A` and `Group B`.

Resulting Permissions for `User1`
    * **Program1**: `User1` will have editor permissions because the editor permission is more permissive than the viewer permission.


**Example**

Create groups:

```graphql
mutation CreateGroups {
  createGroup(input: {
    name: "GroupA",
    description: "Group with editor permissions"
  }) {
    group {
      id
      name
    }
  }
  createGroup(input: {
    name: "GroupB",
    description: "Group with viewer permissions"
  }) {
    group {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Add user to groups:

```graphql
mutation AddUserToGroups {
  updateGroup(id: "groupa-id", input: {
    members: ["user1-id"]
  }) {
    group {
      id
      name
      members {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
  updateGroup(id: "groupb-id", input: {
    members: ["user1-id"]
  }) {
    group {
      id
      name
      members {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Assign permissions to groups:

```graphql
mutation AssignPermissionsToGroups {
  updateProgram(id: "program1-id", input: {
    editors: ["groupa-id"],
    viewers: ["groupb-id"]
  }) {
    program {
      id
      name
      editors {
        id
        name
      }
      viewers {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In a scenario where a user is in multiple groups with different permissions for the same object, the user will inherit the most permissive set of permissions. If a user is in a group with editor permissions and another group with viewer permissions for the same program, the user will have editor permissions for that program. This ensures that the user has the highest level of access granted by any of their group memberships.

## Revoking Permissions

To revoke specific permissions from a user or group, you can use GraphQL mutations to update the permissions of the relevant objects. This involves removing the user or group from the list of entities that have the specified permissions.

**Examples**

Remove user from the list of editors for a control:

```graphql
mutation RemoveEditorFromControl {
  updateControl(id: "control1-id", input: {
    editors: []
  }) {
    control {
      id
      name
      editors {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Remove group from the list of viewers for a program:

```graphql
mutation RemoveViewerFromProgram {
  updateProgram(id: "program1-id", input: {
    viewers: []
  }) {
    program {
      id
      name
      viewers {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
