# Custom Tags

Tags allow organizations to apply flexible, lightweight labels to objects across Openlane.

Located in Organization Settings → Custom Data → Custom Tags, tags help teams organize, filter, and segment compliance data without changing core structure or workflows.

Where Custom Enums create structure, Tags create flexibility.

## What Are Custom Tags?

A Custom Tag is a reusable label that can be applied to records such as controls, risks, tasks, policies, vendors, assets, and more.

Tags are:
- Multi-select
- Optional
- Organization-defined
- Designed for filtering and segmentation

Unlike enums, tags are not tied to strict object structure. They exist to help teams categorize information in ways that reflect how they operate.

## Why Use Custom Tags?

Custom Tags are ideal when:

- You need temporary or evolving classifications
- You want to group related items across object types
- You need additional filtering in dashboards
- You want to flag items for internal workflows

Tags allow teams to adapt quickly without requiring governance changes.

## How to Create a Custom Tag

1. Navigate to Organization Settings → Custom Data → Custom Tags
2. Click Create Tag and provide the following details:
   - **Name**: The name of the tag (e.g., "High Priority", "Needs Review", etc)
   - **Description**: Optional additional context about the tag
   - **Aliases**: Alternative names for the same tag to ensure consistency and avoid duplicates
   - **Color**: Choose a color to visually distinguish this tag in lists and filters
3. Click Save to create the new tag

The tag will become available across supported objects immediately.

Tags can also be created on the fly when editing records, allowing for quick categorization without leaving the workflow.

## How Custom Tags Differ from Custom Enums

| Custom Tags                      | Custom Enums                  |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Flexible, multi-select labels    | Structured dropdown values    |
| Optional and lightweight         | Core object classification    |
| Evolve easily over time          | Governed and standardized     |
| Great for filtering and grouping | Power reporting and structure |
