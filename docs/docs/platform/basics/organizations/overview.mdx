# Managing Your Organization

## What is an Organization?

Your organization is your workspace in Openlane. It's where you manage your team members, control access to resources, configure security settings, and handle billing. Everything you create in Openlane belongs to an organization.

When you sign up for Openlane, a personal organization is automatically created for you. You can also create additional organizations for your teams or companies.

## Setting Up Your Organization Profile

### Updating Organization Name and Details

Navigate to Organization Settings in the console. Here you can update:

- **Organization Name**: Your organization's unique identifier (note: this may be restricted after initial creation)
- **Display Name**: The friendly name shown throughout the console
- **Description**: An optional description of your organization

### Adding an Organization Avatar

You can personalize your organization with a custom avatar that appears in the console:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to the Profile section
3. Upload an image file, or provide a URL to an image hosted elsewhere
4. Save your changes

If you provide both an uploaded file and a URL, the uploaded file will be used.

## Inviting Users to Your Organization

You can invite people to join your organization by sending them email invitations.

To invite a user:

1. Navigate to Organization Settings
2. Go to the Members section
3. Click "Invite Member"
4. Enter the person's email address
5. Select their role (Member, Admin, or Owner)
6. Optionally assign them to specific groups
7. Click "Send Invitation"

The person will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation. This link is valid for 14 days. If they don't accept within that time, you can resend the invitation or create a new one.

### Understanding Roles

When inviting users, you assign them a role that determines what they can do:

- **Member**: Can access organization resources and perform standard tasks
- **Admin**: Can manage organization settings and invite other members
- **Owner**: Has full control over the organization, including deleting it and managing billing

## Restricting Access by Email Domain

You can configure your organization to only allow users with specific email domains. This is useful when you want to ensure only people from your company can join.

To configure allowed domains:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to Security
3. Find the "Allowed Email Domains" section
4. Add your domains (for example: yourcompany.com)
5. Save your changes

Once configured, only users with email addresses from these domains can be invited or join your organization. Note that free email providers like Gmail and Yahoo cannot be used as allowed domains for security reasons.

## Enabling Auto-Join for Your Domain

If you want to let anyone with your company email domain join your organization automatically without requiring individual invitations, you can enable auto-join.

To enable auto-join:

1. First, configure your allowed email domains (see above)
2. Go to Organization Settings
3. Navigate to Security
4. Find the "Auto-Join" setting
5. Enable "Allow users with matching domains to auto-join"
6. Save your changes

With auto-join enabled, anyone who signs up for Openlane with an email address matching your configured domains will automatically become a member of your organization when they verify their email or log in via a social provider.

Important: Only enable this for email domains that you fully control. Users who auto-join will have the Member role by default.

## Setting Up Single Sign-On (SSO)

You can find more information on setting up SSO [here](../../security/authentication/sso.mdx)

## Requiring Multi-Factor Authentication

You can require all members of your organization to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.

To enable MFA enforcement:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to Security
3. Enable "Require Multi-Factor Authentication"
4. Save your changes

Once enabled, all organization members will be prompted to set up 2FA the next time they log in. You can enforce MFA independently or alongside SSO.

## Managing Organization Members

### Viewing Your Team

To see all members of your organization:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to the Members section

Here you'll see a list of all current members, their roles, and when they joined.

### Changing Member Roles

To update a member's role:

1. In the Members section, find the user
2. Click on their current role
3. Select the new role from the dropdown
4. Confirm the change

### Removing Members

To remove someone from your organization:

1. In the Members section, find the user
2. Click the remove/delete option
3. Confirm the removal

Note: Members can also leave the organization themselves at any time.

## Setting Up Billing

### Adding Billing Contact Information

To update billing details:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to Billing
3. Enter or update:
   - Billing contact name
   - Billing email address
   - Phone number (in international format, e.g., +12025551234)
   - Billing address
   - Tax ID (if applicable, such as your VAT number or business registration number)
4. Save your changes

### Adding a Payment Method

To add a payment method for your subscription:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to Billing
3. Click "Add Payment Method"
4. Enter your payment details
5. Submit the form

Your payment information is securely processed through Stripe and is never stored directly in Openlane.

### Viewing Your Subscription

## Managing Feature Modules

Openlane offers additional feature modules that you can add to your organization to access more capabilities.

### Enabling Feature Modules

To add features to your organization:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to Billing, then Subscriptions
3. Browse available feature modules
4. Click "Enable" on any module you want to add
5. Review pricing and confirm

Some modules may be available as part of your plan, while others require an additional subscription fee.

### Viewing Active Modules

To see which features are currently enabled:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to Billing, then Subscriptions
3. View the "Active Modules" section

Here you can see the status of each module (active, trial, inactive) and manage your module subscriptions.

## Deleting Your Organization

Deleting an organization is permanent and cannot be undone. All data, resources, and member associations will be deleted.

To delete your organization:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to the Danger Zone or Delete section
3. Click "Delete Organization"
4. Confirm by typing the organization name
5. Confirm the deletion

Only organization Owners can delete an organization.
