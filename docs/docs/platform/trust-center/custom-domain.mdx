# Custom Domain

Host your Trust Center on your own domain (e.g., `trust.yourcompany.com`) instead of the default Openlane URL. Both URLs remain accessible after setup.

## DNS Configuration

Setting up a vanity domain requires adding two DNS records with your domain provider.

### Step 1: Enter Your Domain

In the Domain settings, enter your desired subdomain (e.g., `trust.yourcompany.com`) and click **Set**. The system generates the DNS records you need.

### Step 2: Add a CNAME Record

The CNAME record routes traffic to the Openlane infrastructure.

```
Type:  CNAME
Host:  trust (or your chosen subdomain)
Value: trust.theopenlane.net
TTL:   3600 (or Auto)
```

### Step 3: Add a TXT Record

The TXT record verifies domain ownership. Use the exact values shown in the console.

```
Type:  TXT
Host:  _openlane-verify.trust (shown in console)
Value: openlane-verification=abc123... (shown in console)
TTL:   3600 (or Auto)
```

### Step 4: Verify

Click **Verify** in the console. DNS changes typically propagate within 2-15 minutes, though it can take up to 72 hours in rare cases.

## Provider-Specific Notes

### Cloudflare

Set Proxy status to "DNS only" (gray cloud) for the CNAME record.

### AWS Route 53

TXT record values need to be wrapped in quotes.

### Root Domain Restriction

Most DNS providers don't allow CNAME records at the root domain. Use a subdomain like `trust.yourcompany.com` instead of `yourcompany.com`.

## Troubleshooting

**Verification keeps failing**
- Ensure the TXT record value is copied exactly (no extra spaces)
- Some providers require quotes around TXT values
- Wait longer for DNS propagation

**SSL certificate warnings**
SSL certificates are provisioned automatically after DNS verification. Wait a few minutes for provisioning to complete.

## Modifying or Removing

To change your domain, click **Edit**, enter the new domain, and update your DNS records to match.

To remove, click the delete icon. Your Trust Center remains accessible at the default URL.
