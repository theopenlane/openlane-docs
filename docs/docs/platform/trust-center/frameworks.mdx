# Frameworks

Display the compliance frameworks and certifications your organization has achieved. Enabled frameworks appear on your public Trust Center.

## Only Enable What You've Achieved

This is important: only enable frameworks you've actually completed through an audit or certification. Visitors see these as trust signals. Misrepresenting compliance status damages trust and may have legal implications.

Enable a framework after:
- Completing the required audit or assessment
- Receiving the certification or attestation
- Confirming the certification is still current

## Available Frameworks

Openlane includes common frameworks: SOC 2, ISO 27001, ISO 27002, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS, NIST CSF, NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, and FedRAMP.

Frameworks marked "Recommended" are ones you have controls mapped to in Openlane, indicating relevance to your compliance program.

## Custom Frameworks

For frameworks not in the standard list (like StateRAMP or industry-specific standards), you can add custom frameworks with your own title, description, and logo.

Custom frameworks can only be deleted when they're not enabled on your Trust Center.

## Publishing Changes

Framework selections use the same draft/publish workflow as the rest of the Trust Center. Toggle frameworks on or off, then click **Publish** to make changes visible.

## Best Practices

- Keep framework selections current as certifications expire or renew
- Upload the corresponding certification documents in the [Documents](./documents.mdx) section
- Review selections periodically to ensure accuracy
