# NDAs

Upload your NDA template that visitors must sign before accessing private documents. Without an NDA configured, visitors cannot access any documents marked as Private.

## How It Works

When a visitor tries to download a private document:

1. They're presented with your NDA
1. They sign electronically
1. Their access request is submitted to you for approval
1. Once approved, they can download the document

## NDA Content

Your NDA should include:

- Parties to the agreement
- Definition of confidential information
- Obligations of the receiving party
- Duration of confidentiality obligations
- Permitted uses and disclosures

Upload the NDA as a PDF. We will append a signing page with the signatory information for your records, so structure your agreement accordingly.

## Updating the NDA

When you upload a new NDA, it applies to future access requests. Visitors who already have approved access don't need to re-sign.

## Best Practices

- Use a mutual NDA to protect both parties
- Keep terms reasonable and industry-standard
- Review the language with legal counsel
- Use a format that signers will recognize
