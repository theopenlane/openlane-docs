# Customer Logos

Display logos of customers who trust your organization. Recognizable customer logos build credibility and demonstrate that established organizations rely on your services.

## Before You Add Logos

Make sure you have permission to display each customer's logo publicly. Check:

- Your customer agreement for reference clauses
- Whether the customer requires explicit approval for logo usage
- Any restrictions on how the logo can be used

Some customers have strict policies about being publicly identified as customers.

## Logo Requirements

- Formats: PNG, JPG, SVG
- Maximum size: 5MB
- Transparent backgrounds work best
- Logos should be legible at small sizes

You can optionally link each logo to the customer's website.

## Best Practices

- Only display logos with explicit permission
- Use high-quality logo files
- Keep the collection current (remove former customers)
- Balance the number of logos to avoid clutter
