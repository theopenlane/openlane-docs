# Documents

Upload security documentation for Trust Center visitors to view or download. Common documents include SOC 2 reports, ISO certifications, penetration test summaries, and security policies.

## Visibility Levels

Each document has a visibility setting that controls who can access it:

| Visibility | Who Can Access |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| **Not Visible** | No one (draft or internal only) |
| **Private** | Visitors who sign your NDA and get approved |
| **Public** | Anyone visiting your Trust Center |

### Private Documents and NDAs

For private documents, the access flow is:

1. Visitor requests access to the document
1. They're prompted to sign your NDA
1. Their request is submitted for your approval
1. Once approved, they can download the document

You need to upload an NDA in the [NDAs](./ndas.mdx) section for this to work.

## Watermarking

Enable watermarking to add the downloader's information to PDF downloads. The watermark includes who downloaded it and when, creating an audit trail and discouraging unauthorized sharing.

Watermark status shows whether processing is complete:
- **Pending**: Document is being processed
- **Completed**: Watermarked version is ready
- **Failed**: Something went wrong (try re-uploading)

## Categories and Standards

Categorize documents so visitors can find what they're looking for. Common categories include:

- SOC 2 Report
- ISO Certification
- Penetration Test
- Security Policy
- Privacy Policy
- Compliance Attestation

You can also associate documents with compliance frameworks. When visitors filter by framework, they'll see the relevant documentation.

## Best Practices

- Set appropriate visibility based on sensitivity (SOC 2 reports are typically private, security policies can be public)
- Enable watermarking for sensitive documents
- Remove or hide outdated documents
- Associate documents with relevant frameworks
