# Branding

Customize your Trust Center to match your organization's brand. You can configure your company information, logo, colors, and theme.

## Preview Before Publishing

Branding changes aren't immediately public. When you make changes:

1. They're saved to a preview state
1. Use the preview URL to see how they look
1. Click **Publish** to make them live
1. Use **Revert Changes** to discard unpublished changes

The preview URL is shown at the top of the branding page.

## Security Contact Email

The security email address appears on your Trust Center as the contact for responsible disclosure. This should route to your security team (typically something like `security@yourcompany.com`).

Security researchers and customers use this to report potential vulnerabilities.

## Theme Options

You can choose between:

- **Easy mode**: Pick a primary color and the system derives the rest
- **Custom mode**: Full control over individual colors

## Logo and Favicon

Upload your logo for the Trust Center header and a favicon for browser tabs.

- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Transparent backgrounds work best for logos

You can upload files directly or provide URLs to hosted images.

## Title and Overview

The title and overview text appear prominently on your Trust Center and are used for SEO. Write an overview that communicates your organization's commitment to security, privacy, and transparency.

Example:
> At [Company], security and privacy are core to how we build our platform. This Trust Center provides an overview of our security practices and access to relevant documentation.

## Best Practices

- Use a high-contrast color scheme for accessibility
- Ensure your logo renders well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Write a clear overview that communicates your security commitment
- Always include a valid security contact email
