# Trust Center

The Trust Center is a public portal intneded to be viewed by your customers and prospects, where you share your security posture, compliance certifications, and data protection practices. Instead of responding to security questionnaires one by one, you give customers and prospects a single place to find the information they need.

## Why It Matters

Every sales cycle involves security questions. Prospects want to see your SOC 2 report, understand your compliance certifications, and know who processes their data. Without a Trust Center, your security team handles these requests manually.

A Trust Center lets you:

- **Answer security questions once**: Post your documentation publicly or behind an NDA
- **Accelerate sales**: Prospects can self-serve instead of waiting for your team
- **Demonstrate transparency**: Show customers you take security seriously
- **Meet compliance requirements**: GDPR and other regulations require subprocessor disclosure

## What You Can Share

### Documents

Upload security documentation like SOC 2 reports, ISO certifications, penetration test summaries, and security policies. Control who can access each document:

- **Public**: Anyone can download
- **Private**: Requires signing an NDA first

### Frameworks

Display the compliance certifications you've achieved (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.). Only enable frameworks you've actually completed - this is a trust signal to customers.

### Subprocessors

List the third-party services that process customer data on your behalf. This transparency helps customers with their own compliance and vendor management.

### Updates

Share brief announcements about new certifications, policy changes, or security improvements. This shows active security management.

## Preview and Publish

Changes you make aren't immediately public. The Trust Center uses a draft/publish workflow:

1. Make changes in the console
2. Preview them using the preview URL
3. Publish when you're ready to go live

This lets you review changes before customers see them.

## Your Trust Center URLs

- **Default URL**: `https://trust.theopenlane.net/{your-organization-slug}`
- **Vanity Domain**: Your custom domain (e.g., `https://trust.yourcompany.com`) if configured

Both URLs work, even after setting up a vanity domain.
