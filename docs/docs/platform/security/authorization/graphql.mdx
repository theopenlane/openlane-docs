## Graphql Collection

For an extensive collection of GraphQL queries and mutations, please refer to our [GraphQL Collection](https://docs.theopenlane.io/graphql?collectionId=b241ca57-3428-4266-b8d3-3ed28cf7adce&focusCollectionId=b241ca57-3428-4266-b8d3-3ed28cf7adce). This collection includes examples for managing permissions, groups, users, and various objects within the Openlane platform.

## Add Internal Policy Creators to an Organization

Using the `updateOrganization` mutation, you can add a group as a object x creator. In this example, we are adding a group as an internal policy creator for the organization. This will allow any member of the group to create policies within the organization.

There are similar fields for adding other object type creators such as:
- `addProcedureCreatorIDs`
- `addRiskCreatorIDs`
- ...etc


```graphql
mutation UpdateOrganization($updateOrganizationId: ID!, $input: UpdateOrganizationInput!) {
  updateOrganization(id: $updateOrganizationId, input: $input) {
    organization {
      internalPolicyCreators {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

{
  "updateOrganizationId": <Organization ID>,
  "input": {
    "addInternalPolicyCreatorIDs": <Group ID>
  }
}
```

## Assign Members to a program

Using the `updateProgram` mutation, you can assign members to a program. In this example, we are adding a user as a member of the program with a specific role, either `admin` or `member`. Similar to the organization level, an admin will have read and write access to all objects within the program, while a member will have read-only access by default.

```graphql
mutation UpdateProgram($updateProgramId: ID!, $input: UpdateProgramInput!) {
  updateProgram(id: $updateProgramId, input: $input) {
    program {
      members {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            role
            user {
              id
              displayName
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

{
  "updateProgramId": <Program ID>,
  "input": {
    "addProgramMembers": [
      {
        "userID": <User ID>,
        "role": <Role> // "admin", "member"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
