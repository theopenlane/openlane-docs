# Programmatic Authentication

## API Tokens

API Tokens provide organization-level programmatic access to Openlane APIs. They are designed for automation, integrations, and services that need to interact with Openlane on behalf of the organization.

:::info
In order to create any tokens, your organization must have a payment method on file.
:::

### Creating an API Token

1. Navigation to **Developer Settings** in the Openlane console
1. Select [API Tokens](https://console.theopenlane.io/organization-settings/developers) from the sidebar
1. Click **Create**
1. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Name**: A human-readable name for the token
   - **Description**: Optional description of the token's purpose
   - **Scopes**: Select the appropriate permission scopes for the token
   - **Expires At**: Expiration date for automatic revocation or choose to never expire
1. Click **Create Token** to generate the token. Make sure to copy the token value as it will only be shown once.
1. If your organization requires SSO enforcement, authorize the token for SSO access.


### Using the API Token

Include the API token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer tola_YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

## Personal Access Tokens

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) provide user-specific programmatic access to Openlane APIs. They inherit the permissions of the user who created them and are intended for personal automation, development tools, and user-specific integrations.

### Creating a Personal Access Token

1. Navigate to **Developer Settings** in the Openlane console
1. Select [Personal Access Tokens](https://console.theopenlane.io/user-settings/developers) from the sidebar
1. Click **Create**
1. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Name**: A human-readable name for the token
   - **Description**: Optional description of the token's purpose
   - **Authorized Organizations**: Select which organizations the token can access
   - **Expires At**: Expiration date for automatic revocation or choose to never expire
1. Click **Create Token** to generate the token. Make sure to copy the token value as it will only be shown once.
1. If a selected organization requires SSO enforcement, authorize the token for SSO access.

### Using the Personal Access Token

Include the Personal Access Token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer tolp_YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

:::tip
When using a Personal Access Token that is authorized for multiple organizations, ensure the `owner_id` is always included in the request, or add the `X-Organization-ID` header to specify which organization context to use for the request.
