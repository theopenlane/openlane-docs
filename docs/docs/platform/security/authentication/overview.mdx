# Authentication in Openlane

Openlane gives organizations flexible and secure ways to authenticate users, ranging from developer-friendly options to enterprise-grade SSO. This page provides a high-level overview of the methods we support and when to use each.

## SSO (Single Sign-On)

All organizations can configure **OIDC-based SSO** with providers like Okta, OneLogin, Google Workspace, and more. This allows users to log in with their corporate credentials and enables centralized access control.

- **Best for** organizations that need centralized access control and compliance with ease of onboarding and offboarding
- **Pros:**
  - Centralized identity management
  - Enforce MFA, password policy, and conditional access
  - Automatic provisioning de-provisioning of users via SCIM (if supported by IdP)
- **Considerations:**
  - Requires admin setup in your IdP.
  - May require extra configuration for group/role claims


## Passkeys (WebAuthn)

Passkeys provide a passwordless login experience using device-based public-key cryptography (Face ID, Touch ID, YubiKey, Windows Hello).

- **Best for** security-focused teams who do not want to set up single sign-on but want strong, phishing-resistant authentication
- **Pros:**
  - Phishing-resistant
  - No shared secret to leak
  - Works across browsers and devices
- **Considerations:**
  - Users must have at least one enrolled device or hardware key.
  - Recommended to set up a backup passkey
  - Requires manual user management

## Social Login

We support sign-in with **Google** and **GitHub**.

- **Best for** Small teams, contractors, open-source contributors.
- **Pros:** No password to manage, uses trusted provider MFA settings
- **Considerations:**
  - Limited control over user lifecycle (e.g., must remove users manually if they leave your company).

## Credentials (Password)

Users can create a traditional **email + password** login.

- **Best for** legacy scenarios or as a fallback when other methods are unavailable.
- **Pros:** universal and simple
- **Considerations:**
  - **Not recommended** due to the weakest security posture
  - Encourage users to enable MFA where possible or migrate to passkeys or single sign-on
