# Practical Risk Management Guide

## Risk Identification Techniques

### Threat Modeling Approach
**When to use:** New systems, applications, or significant changes

**Process:**
1. **Asset Inventory**: List what you're protecting (data, systems, processes)
2. **Threat Actor Analysis**: Who might attack (internal, external, nation-state, criminals)
3. **Attack Vector Mapping**: How they might attack (network, application, physical, social)
4. **Impact Analysis**: What happens if they succeed

**Example Output:**
```
Asset: Customer Credit Card Database
Threat: External cybercriminals
Attack Vectors:
- SQL injection through web application
- Privilege escalation through stolen credentials
- Network lateral movement from compromised workstation
Impact:
- $2M+ in PCI fines
- $500K+ in incident response costs
- Brand reputation damage
- Customer churn
```

### Compliance Gap Analysis
**When to use:** Preparing for new regulations or standards

**Process:**
1. **Requirement Mapping**: Map each compliance requirement to current controls
2. **Gap Identification**: Find requirements without adequate controls
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks of non-compliance
4. **Prioritization**: Focus on highest-risk gaps first

**Example:**
```
GDPR Article 32 - Security of Processing
Current State: Basic encryption, no key rotation
Gap: Lack of encryption key management
Risk: â‚¬20M fine potential + data breach exposure
Priority: High (implement within 90 days)
```

### Business Process Risk Review
**When to use:** Regular business reviews or process changes

**Focus Areas:**
- **Financial processes**: Fraud, errors, unauthorized transactions
- **HR processes**: Insider threats, privileged access abuse
- **IT operations**: System failures, data loss, security breaches
- **Vendor relationships**: Third-party failures, data exposure

## Risk Assessment Methodologies

### Quantitative Risk Assessment
**Best for:** Financial risks, business-critical systems

**Formula:** `Risk = Probability Ã— Impact (in dollars)`

**Example Calculation:**
```
Scenario: Ransomware Attack
Probability: 15% per year (based on industry data)
Impact Components:
- System downtime: $50,000/day Ã— 3 days = $150,000
- Recovery costs: $75,000
- Regulatory fines: $200,000
- Reputation damage: $300,000
Total Impact: $725,000

Annual Risk Exposure: 15% Ã— $725,000 = $108,750
```

**Decision Making:**
- If mitigation costs < $108,750, implement controls
- If mitigation costs > $108,750, consider accepting or transferring risk

### Qualitative Risk Assessment
**Best for:** Emerging threats, reputation risks, complex scenarios

**Assessment Matrix:**
```
           Very Low  Low    Medium  High   Very High
Critical      5      10      15      20       25
High         4       8       12      16       20
Medium       3       6        9      12       15
Low          2       4        6       8       10
Very Low     1       2        3       4        5
```

**Scoring Guidelines:**

**Impact Levels:**
- **Critical (5)**: Existential threat to organization
- **High (4)**: Severe operational or financial impact
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate impact, manageable consequences
- **Low (2)**: Minor impact, minimal disruption
- **Very Low (1)**: Negligible impact

**Likelihood Levels:**
- **Very High**: Almost certain to occur within 1 year
- **High**: Likely to occur within 1-2 years
- **Medium**: Possible within 2-5 years
- **Low**: Unlikely within 5 years
- **Very Low**: Rare or theoretical

## Risk Treatment Decision Framework

### When to ACCEPT Risk
**Criteria:**
- Risk score â‰¤ 6 (Low Ã— Medium or below)
- Cost of mitigation > potential impact
- Risk aligns with organization's risk appetite
- No regulatory requirements for mitigation

**Example:**
```
Risk: Employee personal device theft
Impact: Low (devices have remote wipe capability)
Likelihood: Medium (theft does happen)
Score: 6
Decision: Accept with monitoring
Rationale: Remote wipe capability limits exposure
```

### When to MITIGATE Risk
**Criteria:**
- Risk score â‰¥ 12 (High impact or likelihood)
- Cost-effective mitigation available
- Regulatory compliance requires it
- Risk affects critical business operations

**Example:**
```
Risk: Database SQL injection
Impact: Critical (customer data exposure)
Likelihood: High (common attack vector)
Score: 20
Decision: Implement parameterized queries + WAF
Cost: $50,000 implementation + $20,000/year
Benefit: Reduces risk score to 4
```

### When to TRANSFER Risk
**Criteria:**
- High financial impact but low likelihood
- Specialized risks outside expertise
- Cost of insurance < cost of mitigation
- Contractual requirements allow transfer

**Example:**
```
Risk: Natural disaster affecting data center
Impact: Critical ($2M+ business interruption)
Likelihood: Very Low (1 in 100 year event)
Decision: Business interruption insurance
Cost: $25,000/year premium
Coverage: $5M business interruption
```

### When to AVOID Risk
**Criteria:**
- Risk is unacceptable and unmitigatable
- Activity provides low business value
- Regulatory environment too risky
- Reputational risks too high

**Example:**
```
Risk: Cryptocurrency trading platform
Regulatory Risk: Unclear/changing regulations
Reputational Risk: Association with criminal activity
Decision: Avoid - don't enter this market
Rationale: Risk/reward ratio unfavorable
```

## Risk Monitoring and KPIs
