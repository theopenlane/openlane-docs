# Standards

Standards represent compliance frameworks and regulations that organizations must adhere to. Openlane supports a wide range of industry standards including SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST frameworks, and industry-specific regulations.

## What is a Standard?

A Standard in Openlane represents a formal compliance framework, regulation, or set of guidelines that defines security, privacy, or operational requirements. Standards provide the foundation for compliance programs by defining the controls and requirements that organizations must implement.

## Compliance Relevance

Standards are critical in compliance management because they:

- **Define Requirements**: Establish specific controls and procedures organizations must implement
- **Provide Structure**: Offer a systematic approach to security and compliance
- **Enable Certification**: Allow organizations to achieve formal certification or attestation
- **Facilitate Audits**: Provide clear criteria for audit assessments
- **Support Risk Management**: Help identify and mitigate compliance risks

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Compliance
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Service organization compliance for cloud providers
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system certification
- **PCI DSS**: Payment processing security requirements

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR**: European data protection requirements
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data privacy and security
- **SOX**: Financial reporting controls and auditing

### Industry Frameworks
- **NIST CSF**: Cybersecurity risk management framework
- **CIS Controls**: Critical security controls implementation
- **OWASP SAMM**: Software security maturity model

## Standard Properties

### Core Fields
- **Name**: Full name of the standard (e.g., "Service Organization Control 2")
- **Short Name**: Common abbreviation (e.g., "SOC 2")
- **Framework**: Unique identifier with version (e.g., "SOC2-2017")
- **Governing Body**: Organization that manages the standard (e.g., "AICPA")
- **Version**: Standard version number
- **Domains**: Applicable security domains (availability, confidentiality, etc.)
- **Status**: Current status (active, draft, archived)

### Access Control
- **Is Public**: Available to all users in the system
- **Free to Use**: Can be used without licensing restrictions
- **Organization**: Owner organization for private standards

### Documentation
- **Description**: Detailed description of the standard's purpose and scope
- **Details**: Implementation guidance and requirements
- **References**: External links and documentation

## GraphQL Operations

### Query Standards

```graphql
# Get all available standards
query GetStandards {
  standards {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        shortName
        framework
        governingBody
        version
        domains
        status
        isPublic
        freeToUse
        description
        createdAt
        updatedAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
# Get a specific standard with its controls
query GetStandardWithControls($id: ID!) {
  standard(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    shortName
    framework
    governingBody
    domains
    description
    controls {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          displayID
          description
          category
          subcategory
          controlType
          status
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Search Standards

```graphql
# Search standards by name or framework
query SearchStandards($query: String!) {
  standardSearch(query: $query) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        shortName
        framework
        governingBody
        description
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Create Standard

```graphql
mutation CreateStandard($input: CreateStandardInput!) {
  createStandard(input: $input) {
    standard {
      id
      name
      shortName
      framework
      governingBody
      version
      domains
      status
      isPublic
      freeToUse
    }
  }
}
```

**Input Example:**
```json
{
  "input": {
    "name": "Service Organization Control 2",
    "shortName": "SOC 2",
    "framework": "SOC2-2017",
    "governingBody": "AICPA",
    "version": "2017",
    "domains": ["confidentiality", "availability", "security"],
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "isPublic": true,
    "freeToUse": false,
    "description": "SOC 2 defines criteria for managing customer data based on five trust service principles"
  }
}
```

### Update Standard

```graphql
mutation UpdateStandard($id: ID!, $input: UpdateStandardInput!) {
  updateStandard(id: $id, input: $input) {
    standard {
      id
      name
      version
      status
      updatedAt
    }
  }
}
```

## API Access

Standards are managed exclusively through GraphQL operations. There are no REST endpoints for standard CRUD operations.

## Common Workflows

### 1. Import Industry Standard

```graphql
# Import SOC 2 standard
mutation ImportSOC2 {
  createStandard(input: {
    name: "Service Organization Control 2"
    shortName: "SOC 2"
    framework: "SOC2-2017"
    governingBody: "AICPA"
    version: "2017"
    domains: ["security", "availability", "confidentiality", "processing_integrity", "privacy"]
    status: ACTIVE
    isPublic: true
    freeToUse: false
    description: "SOC 2 is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers securely manage data"
  }) {
    standard {
      id
      name
      framework
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Create Custom Standard

```graphql
# Create organization-specific standard
mutation CreateCustomStandard {
  createStandard(input: {
    name: "Company Security Framework"
    shortName: "CSF"
    framework: "COMPANY-CSF-2024"
    governingBody: "Internal Security Team"
    version: "1.0"
    domains: ["security", "privacy"]
    status: ACTIVE
    isPublic: false
    freeToUse: true
    description: "Internal security framework for compliance management"
  }) {
    standard {
      id
      name
      isPublic
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Find Standards by Domain

```graphql
# Find all standards covering privacy domain
query PrivacyStandards {
  standards(where: {
    domains: {
      hasAny: ["privacy"]
    }
    status: {
      eq: ACTIVE
    }
  }) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        shortName
        domains
        governingBody
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Standard Management
1. **Use Official Frameworks**: Import official framework identifiers and versions
2. **Keep Updated**: Track standard updates and new versions
3. **Document Changes**: Maintain version history and change logs
4. **Access Control**: Set appropriate public/private flags

### Framework Selection
1. **Business Requirements**: Choose standards based on business needs
2. **Industry Requirements**: Consider industry-specific standards
3. **Customer Expectations**: Align with customer compliance expectations
4. **Risk Assessment**: Select frameworks that address key risks

### Implementation Planning
1. **Gap Analysis**: Compare current state against standard requirements
2. **Phased Approach**: Implement controls in logical phases
3. **Resource Planning**: Allocate appropriate resources for implementation
4. **Timeline Management**: Set realistic implementation timelines

## Integration Points

### With Controls
- Standards contain multiple controls that implement specific requirements
- Controls inherit context and metadata from their parent standard
- Control mappings enable cross-standard compliance

### With Programs
- Standards are implemented through compliance programs
- Programs can address multiple standards simultaneously
- Program scope defines which standard requirements apply

### With Evidence
- Evidence collection is organized by standard requirements
- Audit evidence demonstrates compliance with standard controls
- Evidence retention follows standard-specific requirements
