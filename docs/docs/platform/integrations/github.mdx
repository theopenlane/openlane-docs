# ![github integration](./assets/github.png) GitHub Integration Guide

The GitHub OAuth integration connects your repositories to Openlane for continuous security alert ingestion. Dependabot, code scanning, and secret scanning alerts flow into Openlane as normalized vulnerability records, giving you a single place to track remediation and SLA compliance (SOC 2: CC7, CC8).

## Integration Snapshot

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| Primary use case | Repository security alert ingestion and metadata collection |
| Data direction | One-way (GitHub -> Openlane), read-only |
| Auth model | OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow |
| Openlane records created | Vulnerabilities (created or updated), linked to your GitHub integration |

## Key Capabilities

- **Repository Security Alert Ingestion:** Collects Dependabot, code scanning, and secret scanning alerts and normalizes them into vulnerability records for remediation tracking (SOC 2: CC7, CC8).
- **Repository Metadata Collection:** Pulls repository context so you can scope vulnerability ownership and track which teams are responsible for remediation.
- **OAuth-Based Read Access:** Connects with user-approved scopes. Openlane reads your security data without making changes to your repositories.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub OAuth application configured for Openlane callback.
- Organization approval if repositories are managed in org-owned spaces.
- The following OAuth scopes are requested during authorization:

| OAuth Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `repo` | Access repository metadata and security endpoints |
| `security_events` | Access Dependabot, code scanning, and secret scanning alert APIs |
| `admin:repo_hook` | Manage repository webhooks for event delivery |
| `read:user`, `user:email` | Identity validation during OAuth |

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Configure GitHub OAuth App

1. Configure callback URL for Openlane.
2. Ensure required scopes are available.
3. If needed, authorize the app for organization repositories.

### Step 2: Connect in Openlane

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Integrations** and find **GitHub**.
2. Click **Connect**. You will be redirected to GitHub to authorize access.
3. Review and approve the requested permissions.
4. After authorization, you are redirected back to Openlane and the connection is saved.

## Validate Connection

After saving, Openlane runs a health check against GitHub and displays the result on the **Installed** tab of the Integrations page. A **Healthy** badge confirms connectivity. If the badge shows **Needs Attention**, review the troubleshooting section below.

## What Openlane Creates From Alerts

Openlane ingests supported GitHub alert types and maps them into vulnerability records:

- **Dependabot alerts** map advisory severity, summary, description, and CVE (when present).
- **Code scanning alerts** map rule severity and rule summary context.
- **Secret scanning alerts** map secret-type context.

For each ingested alert, Openlane:

- Creates or updates a vulnerability record.
- Deduplicates by source external ID (with CVE fallback matching when available).
- Links the vulnerability to the GitHub integration.
- Stores repository context as the external owner reference.
- Stores source metadata and payload context for auditability.

### What You Can Do Next

Once vulnerabilities land in Openlane, you can link them to affected assets, assign remediation owners, and track resolution against SLAs. Useful when writing your vulnerability management narrative for SOC 2 CC7 (system monitoring) or pulling evidence for ISO 27001 A.12.6 (technical vulnerability management).

## Disconnect

To remove this integration, navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Integrations** and select the **Installed** tab. Open the menu on the integration card and select **Disconnect**. This removes stored credentials and stops all collection activity. You can reconnect later by configuring the integration again.

## Troubleshooting

- **No repositories visible:** verify OAuth approval at org scope.
- **No alerts ingested:** verify security alert features are enabled on target repositories.
- **OAuth callback errors:** verify callback URL and app settings.
