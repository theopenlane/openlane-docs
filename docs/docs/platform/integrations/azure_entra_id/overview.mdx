# Azure Entra ID Integration Guide ![azure entra id integration](../assets/azure.png)

If your organization uses Microsoft Entra ID for identity management, this integration brings your directory into Openlane so you can run User Access Reviews, verify authentication policies, and maintain a current view of who has access to what (SOC 2: CC6, ISO 27001: A.9).

## Key Capabilities

- **Directory and Group Sync:** Ingests user identities, group memberships, and role assignments from your Entra tenant, giving you the identity baseline you need for access reviews and onboarding/offboarding evidence.
- **Authentication Policy Visibility:** Surfaces tenant-level authentication configuration so you can verify that MFA policies and conditional access rules align with your security standards.
- **Read-Only Access:** Pulls data into Openlane via Microsoft Graph without changing any Entra tenant settings.

## Prerequisites

- Permission to create or manage app registrations in Entra.
- Microsoft Graph permissions with admin consent for tenant metadata access.
- Openlane callback URL available for OAuth setup.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Configure Microsoft App Registration

1. Register or select an app in Entra ID.
2. Set the Openlane callback redirect URI.
3. Grant and consent required Graph permissions (including `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` and `offline_access`).

### Step 2: Connect in Openlane

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Integrations** and find **Azure Entra ID**.
2. Click **Connect**. You will be redirected to Microsoft to authorize access.
3. Sign in and grant the requested permissions.
4. After authorization, you are redirected back to Openlane and the connection is saved.

### Step 3: Post-Connection Configuration

After the OAuth connection is established, provide additional tenant context:

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `tenantId` | Yes | Azure AD tenant ID used for Graph API calls |
| `appId` | No | Tenant-specific Azure app registration override |
| `appSecret` | No | Secret tied to the provided app registration override |

## Validate Connection

After saving, Openlane runs a health check against Azure Entra ID and displays the result on the **Installed** tab of the Integrations page. A **Healthy** badge confirms connectivity. If the badge shows **Needs Attention**, review the troubleshooting section below.

## What Openlane Syncs

Openlane syncs directory users, group memberships, and tenant metadata from your Entra ID environment. This gives you a continuously updated identity baseline you can use for User Access Reviews, onboarding/offboarding verification, and role-based access validation. Useful when you're pulling evidence for SOC 2 CC6 (logical and physical access) or ISO 27001 A.9 (access control).

## Disconnect

To remove this integration, navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Integrations** and select the **Installed** tab. Open the menu on the integration card and select **Disconnect**. This removes stored credentials and stops all collection activity. You can reconnect later by configuring the integration again.

## Troubleshooting

- **Consent errors:** verify admin consent for required Graph permissions.
- **Token failures:** verify tenant/client values and secret validity.
