# ![cloudflare integration](./assets/cloudflare.png) Cloudflare Integration Guide

If your traffic runs through Cloudflare, this integration connects your account and zone configuration to Openlane so you have visibility into your network boundary controls (SOC 2: CC6.6, CC6.7; ISO 27001: A.13).

## Key Capabilities

- **Infrastructure Visibility:** Connects account and zone scope metadata to Openlane, supporting evidence for network security controls (SOC 2: CC6.6, CC6.7).
- **Read-Only API Access:** Validates token health without changing your Cloudflare configuration.
- **Scoped Connection Options:** Limit collection scope by account and optional zone selection so you only pull what falls within your compliance boundary.

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account access with permission to create API tokens.
- A custom API token with read scopes for required account and zone resources.
- Cloudflare account ID (and optional zone IDs if scoping to specific zones).

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a Cloudflare API Token

1. Sign in to the Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Create a custom API token for integration use.
3. Assign read-only scopes for your Cloudflare environment (account settings, Zero Trust policies, and scanning features as needed).
4. Save the token securely.

### Step 2: Connect in Openlane

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Integrations** and find **Cloudflare**.
2. Click **Configure** and enter the required fields:

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `apiToken` | Yes | Authenticates Cloudflare API requests |
| `accountId` | Yes | Defines account-level scope |
| `zoneIds` | No | Restricts collection to selected zones |
| `email` | No | Account email (required for legacy key authentication) |
| `apiKey` | No | Global API key (legacy email/key authentication path) |
| `enableScanner` | No | Enables Cloudflare scanning utility if the account is licensed |
| `scannerLabel` | No | Label recorded with scan jobs for traceability |

3. Click **Save**.

## Validate Connection

After saving, Openlane runs a health check against Cloudflare and displays the result on the **Installed** tab of the Integrations page. A **Healthy** badge confirms connectivity. If the badge shows **Needs Attention**, review the troubleshooting section below.

## What Openlane Syncs

Openlane validates your token and records account and zone scope context. This data feeds into your boundary protection evidence for SOC 2 CC6.6 and CC6.7, and supports network security management controls under ISO 27001 A.13.

## Disconnect

To remove this integration, navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Integrations** and select the **Installed** tab. Open the menu on the integration card and select **Disconnect**. This removes stored credentials and stops all collection activity. You can reconnect later by configuring the integration again.

## Troubleshooting

- **Token verification failed:** verify token value and permissions.
- **Scope mismatch:** verify `accountId` and selected zone scope are correct.
- **Permission issues:** expand token read scopes for required resources.
