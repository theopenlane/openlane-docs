# ![vercel integration](./assets/vercel.png) Vercel Integration Guide

If your team deploys through Vercel, this integration brings your project and deployment history into Openlane. That means less time manually gathering deployment evidence when you need to demonstrate change management controls (SOC 2: CC8, ISO 27001: A.14).

## Key Capabilities

- **Deployment History and Context:** Ingests project configuration, deployment records, and environment details so you have a continuous record of what shipped, when, and to which environment.
- **Configuration Drift Awareness:** Tracks deployment and environment configuration over time, helping you spot unintended changes before they become audit findings.
- **Scoped Coverage Options:** Supports optional team and project-level scoping so you only collect what falls within your compliance boundary.

## Prerequisites

- Vercel API token with read access to projects and settings.
- Optional team or project identifiers for narrower collection.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Vercel API Token

1. In Vercel, navigate to your account settings and generate a personal or team API token.
2. Confirm the token can read required project data.

### Step 2: Connect in Openlane

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Integrations** and find **Vercel**.
2. Click **Configure** and enter the required fields:

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `apiToken` | Yes | Authenticates Vercel API access |
| `teamId` | No | Team identifier for team-scoped access |
| `projectId` | No | Restricts collection to a single project |
| `environment` | No | Preferred deployment environment (`production`, `preview`, or `development`; default: `production`) |
| `captureDeployHooks` | No | Include deploy hook metadata alongside the integration (default: off) |
| `metadataTags` | No | Tags that categorize imported project metadata |

3. Click **Save**.

## Validate Connection

After saving, Openlane runs a health check against Vercel and displays the result on the **Installed** tab of the Integrations page. A **Healthy** badge confirms connectivity. If the badge shows **Needs Attention**, review the troubleshooting section below.

## What Openlane Syncs

Openlane syncs your Vercel project configuration, deployment history, and environment settings. This gives you a continuously updated record of your deployment activity, including what was deployed, to which environment, and whether configuration has drifted from expected state. Useful when writing your change management narrative for SOC 2 CC8 or pulling deployment evidence for ISO 27001 A.14.

## Disconnect

To remove this integration, navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Integrations** and select the **Installed** tab. Open the menu on the integration card and select **Disconnect**. This removes stored credentials and stops all collection activity. You can reconnect later by configuring the integration again.

## Troubleshooting

- **Unauthorized responses:** verify token scope and validity.
- **No projects returned:** verify the token owner has access to the target team or projects.
