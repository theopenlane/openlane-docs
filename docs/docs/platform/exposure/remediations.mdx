# Remediations

## Overview

Remediations track how your organization plans, executes, and verifies corrective actions for vulnerabilities and findings. They are the operational bridge between identifying an issue and demonstrating it was addressed.

Remediation records can include ownership, due dates, ticket and repository references, completion timestamps, and related evidence. They are most commonly linked back to the finding or vulnerability they are intended to resolve.

## Compliance Significance

- SOC 2: CC5 and CC7 control operation evidence
- ISO 27001: treatment and continuous improvement expectations

## Practical Examples

- An engineering team links a remediation record to a high-severity finding and tracks ticket and pull request progress.
- A compliance manager reviews overdue remediations weekly and escalates high-priority gaps.
