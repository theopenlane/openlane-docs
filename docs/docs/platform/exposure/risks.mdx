# Risks

## Overview

Risks in Openlane represent potential events that could negatively impact security, compliance, or business outcomes. They give your team a structured way to define impact, likelihood, ownership, and mitigation plans.

Risk records are usually connected to the controls that treat them and the action plans or tasks used to reduce them. When needed, teams also relate risks to the affected asset or vendor to make ownership and impact clearer.

## Compliance Significance

- SOC 2: CC3, CC5, CC7, CC9
- ISO 27001: risk assessment and treatment expectations

## Practical Examples

- A security team tracks "privileged access misuse" as a risk and ties it to IAM controls and quarterly access reviews.
- A compliance lead uses risk score and status to prioritize remediation planning ahead of audit windows.
