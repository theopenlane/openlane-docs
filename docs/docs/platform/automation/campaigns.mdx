# Campaigns

## Overview

Campaigns are structured outreach runs for policy attestations, training acknowledgements, and questionnaire requests. They let you target many recipients, track progress at the recipient level, and manage follow-up sends from one workflow.

Campaign records are most commonly tied to an assessment template and a recipient audience (such as personnel, contacts, users, or groups).

## Campaign Lifecycle

```

## Compliance Significance

- SOC 2: CC1, CC2, CC5 communication and governance evidence
- ISO 27001: awareness, policy communication, and recurring control operation

## Practical Examples

- A security team launches quarterly policy acknowledgment campaigns for all personnel.
- A vendor risk team runs an annual questionnaire campaign and tracks completion before renewal decisions.
