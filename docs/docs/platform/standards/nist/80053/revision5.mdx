NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5, titled "Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations," provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls designed to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, and the nation from a diverse set of threats and risks.

## Key Features of NIST 800-53 Revision 5

NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 introduces next-generation security and privacy controls that are designed to address the evolving threat landscape. Key highlights include:

- **Outcome-Based Controls:** The controls are structured to focus on the outcomes organizations need to achieve, rather than prescribing specific technologies or methods.
- **Integration of Privacy:** Privacy controls are fully integrated with security controls, supporting a unified approach to protecting both information and individual privacy.
- **Support for Modern Technologies:** The controls are adaptable to cloud, mobile, and other modern computing environments.
- **Emphasis on Supply Chain Risk Management:** New controls address risks associated with supply chains, including the integrity and security of components and services.
- **Flexible and Modular:** The framework allows organizations to tailor controls to their specific missions, business processes, and risk environments.

These enhancements help organizations manage risk more effectively and support compliance with a wide range of regulatory requirements.
