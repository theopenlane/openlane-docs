# Overview

NIST 800-53 is a cybersecurity standard and compliance framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), outlining a set of security controls for federal information systems, designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by mitigating risks from various threats through specific controls like access management, awareness training, and incident response procedures.
