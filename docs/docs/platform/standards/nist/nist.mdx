# Overview

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory U.S. federal agency that develops and promotes measurement standards and technology. NIST's mission is to improve the quality of life, enhance productivity, and facilitate trade. NIST's work is essential for ensuring the security and privacy of information systems and data, particularly in the context of federal agencies and critical infrastructure.

[NIST 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final) is a set of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. It provides a comprehensive framework for managing risk and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. NIST 800-53 is widely used by federal agencies, contractors, and other organizations that handle sensitive information.
