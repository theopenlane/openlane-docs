## What is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?

The NIST CSF is a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity that provides a common taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to:

- **Describe** their current cybersecurity posture
- **Target** their desired cybersecurity posture
- **Identify and prioritize** opportunities for improvement
- **Assess progress** toward their target state
- **Communicate** cybersecurity risk internally and externally

### Key Characteristics

- **Voluntary and Flexible**: Adaptable to any organization regardless of size or sector
- **Risk-Based**: Focuses on business-driven cybersecurity outcomes
- **Technology Neutral**: Not prescriptive about specific technologies or solutions
- **Living Framework**: Designed to evolve with the threat landscape
- **Cost-Effective**: Leverages existing standards and practices
- **Outcomes-Focused**: Emphasizes desired cybersecurity outcomes rather than compliance checklists

## Core Functions

The NIST CSF 2.0 framework is structured around six core functions that provide a high-level view of the cybersecurity lifecycle:

## Implementation Tiers

The Framework defines four Implementation Tiers to help organizations understand their current approach to cybersecurity risk management:

### Tier 1: Partial
- **Risk Management Process**: Ad hoc, reactive
- **Integrated Risk Management**: Limited awareness
- **External Participation**: Minimal information sharing

### Tier 2: Risk Informed
- **Risk Management Process**: Risk-informed but not organization-wide
- **Integrated Risk Management**: Some integration with enterprise risk management
- **External Participation**: Aware of cybersecurity supply chain risks

### Tier 3: Repeatable
- **Risk Management Process**: Organization-wide approach with regular updates
- **Integrated Risk Management**: Integrated into organization-wide risk management
- **External Participation**: Understands dependencies and partners

### Tier 4: Adaptive
- **Risk Management Process**: Adaptive and improved through lessons learned
- **Integrated Risk Management**: Real-time, integrated risk management
- **External Participation**: Proactive information sharing and collaboration

## Framework Profiles

Profiles represent the alignment of the Framework Core with the business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of a specific organization.

### Current Profile
- Represents "as-is" state
- Shows current cybersecurity posture
- Identifies existing capabilities and gaps

### Target Profile
- Represents desired "to-be" state
