# Registry

Registry is your compliance source of truth for who is involved, what you rely on, and what is in scope.

## Why It Matters

Audits move faster when you can answer three questions quickly:

- Who works in the environment?
- Which third parties are involved?
- Which assets are in scope?

Registry gives you those answers in one place.

## What's in This Section

- [Personnel](./personnel.mdx) - Workforce records for employees and contractors (Identity Holders)
- [Entities](./entities.mdx) - Vendors and third parties your business depends on
- [Assets](./assets.mdx) - Systems, services, and devices you need to govern

## Compliance Significance

- SOC 2: CC1, CC2, CC5, CC6, CC7, CC9
- ISO 27001: A.5, A.6, A.8, A.15
- HIPAA: Administrative and technical safeguards

## Typical Outcomes

- Cleaner audit scoping and faster evidence collection
- Better ownership and accountability across teams
- Stronger vendor and asset governance without spreadsheet churn
