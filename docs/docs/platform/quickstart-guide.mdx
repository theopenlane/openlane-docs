## Using the Quickstart Process

A blank canvas represents so many wonderful things: possibility, creative freedom, and your as yet unfulfilled potential. For some, it can also be daunting, paralyzing, or tedious to think of everything necessary to fill that canvas. At Openlane, a blank canvas is a new program containing no controls, policies, risks, or evidence. You might have a great idea of how to build out a new program; you may even have a full set of custom controls with mappings ready to direct upload into the platform for management. Translating those controls into tasks or deciding what to tackle first may have you at a standstill. To help you get off to a running start, we built the quickstart process.

## QuickStart Program Creation

1. Navigate to “+ Create” in the left-hand menu, and select “Create Program”
2. Click through the first panels to select the SOC 2 framework (our most common use-case) or select another framework by grabbing the card on the right.
3. Follow the prompts, adding your teammates (or not), and clicking “Ready to Start”.

Congratulations!! You now have controls in your organization! You are ready to start reading through and figuring out what tasks to pick up next. 

### Building Your Program

From here, you may take any path forward you desire. As a great first step, navigate to the controls and, when you find one that you know will require you to build a new policy, click in the top right to create a task for yourself or someone on your team. Take the time to touch as many controls as you can. The better you understand the requirements, the more likely you’ll take a holistic approach to addressing them.

## Keep the Momentum Going

Now that you have some tasks to get you started, work your way through building the program one step at a time. Depending on your program and controls, feel free to reference:
