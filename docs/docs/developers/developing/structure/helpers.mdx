https://github.com/theopenlane/gqlgen-plugins
:::

[gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/reference/plugins/) provides a way to hook into the
gqlgen code generation lifecycle. This repo contains several hooks that are used within
the core repo gqlgen generation process.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="resolver gen">
        This hook will override the default generated resolver functions with the
        templates for CRUD operations.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="bulk gen">
        Creates resolvers to do bulk operations for a schema for both bulk input or a
        csv file upload input.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="search gen">
        Creates search resolvers to search on fields within the ent schema. Fields in the schema
        that should be searchable by non-admins should include the annotation:

        ```go
        Annotations(
            entx.FieldSearchable(),
        )
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## entx

:::note[Repository]
https://github.com/theopenlane/entx
:::

A helper package for working with [ent](https://entgo.io/), which includes the following high-level utilities:

- [Mixin](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-mixin) used for assigning a different ID type than the one generated by `ent` (we use ULIDs)
- [Mixin](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-mixin) used for assigning some default columns (`created_at`, `created_by`, etc. - check out the `mixin` directory for more details)
- A vanilla, drop-in, setup for using `ent` with our standard tool chains `gqlgen`, `gqlgenc`, and some other helpers
- Soft-delete extension with cascade delete functionality added in
- enthistory extension for generating history tables using ent - the plugin will add-on to your existing `entc` usage and enumerate over your current schemas to create new "history" schemas containing an inventory of the changes related to the existing tables.
