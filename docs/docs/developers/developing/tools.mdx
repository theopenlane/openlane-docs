# Tools

Developing within the Openlane ecosystem involves a few mandatory tools; please read up on
these and familiarize yourself if you're interested in making additions or
changes!

1. [ent](https://entgo.io/) - insane entity mapping tool, definitely not an ORM
   but kind of an ORM (handles our relational data storage, mappings, codegen
   processes)
1. [atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) - Schema generation and migrations (can be
   disabled in lieu of migrations on disk)
1. [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) - Secondary database migration
   utility we also use for seeding data
1. [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/) - Code generation + GraphQL server building
   from from `ent` schema definitions
1. [gqlgenc](https://github.com/Yamashou/gqlgenc) - Client building utilities
   with GraphQL
1. [openfga](https://openfga.dev/) - Flexible authorization/permission engine
   inspired by Google Zanzibar
1. [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) - High performance, extensible, minimalist
   Go web framework
1. [koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf) - Configuration management library
   which parses command line arguments, Go structs + creates our main
   configuration files

We also leverage many secondary technologies in use, including (but not limited
to!):

1. [taskfiles](taskfiles.mdx) - So much better than Make zomg
1. [redis](https://redis.io/) - in-memory datastore used for sessions, caching
1. [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
1. [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) - an annoyingly
   opinionated linter
1. [buildkite](https://buildkite.com/theopenlane) - our CI system of choice
   (with github actions providing some intermediary support)
