# Server Startup

### Starting the Server

1. Copy the config, this is in .gitignore so you do not have to worry about
   accidentally committing secrets

   ```bash
   cp ./config/config-dev.example.yaml ./config/.config.yaml
   ```

1. Update the configuration with whatever respective settings you desire; the
   defaults inside should allow you to run the server without a problem

1. Use the task commands to start the server

   Run the core server in development mode with dependencies in docker

   ```bash
   task run-dev
   ```

   Run fully in docker

   ```bash
   task docker:all:up
   ```

1. In a separate terminal, with the server running, you can create a verified
   test user by running:

   ```bash
   task cli:user:all
   ```

1. Once this command has finished ^, you can login and perform actions as user
   `mitb@theopenlane.io` with password `mattisthebest1234`

### CSRF Tokens

The server enforces CSRF protection on all mutating requests. Clients must
include a valid token in the `X-CSRF-Token` header. Existing client code can
create a client with the CSRF Token using the following function. This function
will grab a valid CSRF token from the `/livez` endpoint and send it for subsequent requests.

```go
 client.ClientWithCSRFToken(ctx, opts...)
```

You can also manually call `InitCSRF` on the client:

```go
ctx := context.Background()
if err := client.InitCSRF(ctx); err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

The CLI has been updated to call `ClientWithCSRFToken` automatically, but other custom clients will need to adopt one of the approaches.

NOTE: Because the CSRF middleware stores the token only in the client’s cookie and not on the server, restarting the core server (or core server running in Kubernetes pods) does not invalidate the token. When the middleware receives a request, it checks the token in the `csrf_token` cookie against the `X-CSRF-Token` header. If the cookie is already present, that same token is used — no new token is generated. The token cookie persists until it expires (default 24h), so clients will continue to send the same value even if the server has restarted.

Therefore, rolling restarts on Kubernetes will not force new tokens to be issued and should not cause requests to fail, provided the client retains its CSRF cookie.
