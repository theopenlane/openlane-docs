# Creating a New Schema

Workflow of generating a new schema and related CRUD resolvers

## Create a new schema file
    ```bash
    task db:newschema -- MyNewSchema
    ```
## Update new templated schema
    The file will be located in `internal/ent/schema/`, the file name matching the schema name
    1. Add [fields](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-fields) to the schema
    1. Add [edges](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-edges) to the schema for 1:1, 1:m, or m:m relationships with other objects
    1. Add [indexes](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-indexes) to the schema
        :::note[Example]
        A common use in our codebase is to add an index to allow soft-deleted names to be reused even when the name is required to be unique.
        ```go
        index.Fields("name").
			Unique().Annotations(entsql.IndexWhere("deleted_at is NULL")),
        ```
        :::
    1. Review and update the [annotations](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-annotations) on the templated schema
    1. Add [hooks](https://entgo.io/docs/hooks/) for use on mutations, these act as middleware that can happen before or after the request is executed
    1. Add [interceptors](https://entgo.io/docs/interceptors) for use on queries, these act as middleware that can happen before or after the request is executed, commonly used to filter data
    1. Review and update the [privacy](https://entgo.io/docs/privacy) policy on the templated schema

## Generate the CRUD resolvers
    ```bash
    task generate
    ```

    This will take a few minutes to run the first time, the main generation that will happen:
    1. **entc** - ORM functions for the schema, for example your getters and setters for fields, creating, deleting or updating objects in the database, etc.
    1. **gqlgen** - graphapi resolvers and basic query generation
    1. **gqlgenc** - golang api client based on queries

## Generate the Migrations
    This will generate the goose and atlas migrations based on the ent schema changes
    ```bash
    task db:create
    ```
## Stub out the CRUD cli commands
    ```bash
    task cli:generate
    ```

    :::info
    The cli flags for create and update, along with field output (in `root.go`) will need to be manually updated
