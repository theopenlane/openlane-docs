# Integration Architecture

Openlane integration flows are designed around three consistent layers:

1. Provider connection (OAuth/OIDC, API key, or webhook trust setup)
1. Normalization and validation into Openlane domain objects
1. Downstream automation and evidence-ready auditability

## Design Goals

1. Keep provider-specific logic isolated and replaceable
1. Preserve tenant boundaries and authorization context at ingest time
1. Support retries and asynchronous processing for external dependency stability
1. Maintain traceability from external event to internal record changes
