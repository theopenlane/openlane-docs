# Ingest Pipeline

Openlane uses a provider-agnostic ingest pipeline to normalize external alert payloads into internal records.

## Why It Exists

1. Keep provider integrations decoupled from persistence logic
1. Support per-provider or per-alert mapping overrides without code changes
1. Apply shared validation before upsert

## High-Level Flow

1. Provider operation emits `AlertEnvelope` payloads
1. Mapping context is built from integration config and operation state
1. CEL filter expressions decide which envelopes to ingest
1. CEL mapping expressions normalize fields
1. Normalized output is validated and persisted

## Key Components

1. `internal/integrations/ingest`
1. Mapping schemas in generated integration models
1. Default mappings (for example GitHub)

Refer to `/Users/manderson/core/internal/integrations/ingest/README.md` for implementation details and extension patterns.
