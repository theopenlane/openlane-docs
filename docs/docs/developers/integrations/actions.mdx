# Setup Openlane Action
:::note
This document describes the [theopenlane/setup-openlane](https://github.com/theopenlane/setup-openlane) GitHub Action, which automates the installation and configuration of the Openlane CLI tool within GitHub Actions workflows.
:::

## How it works
This GitHub Action automates the installation and setup of the Openlane CLI tool within your GitHub Actions workflows. It typically does the following:
1. Downloads and installs the Openlane CLI tool in your GitHub Actions job
1. Adds it to `PATH` so that subsequent workflow steps can use the CLI.
1. Optionally configures environment variables, tokens, or default settings for the CLI.
1. Simplifies your workflow so you don’t have to manually script install/setup each time.

## Getting Started

Here is how to use the action in your GitHub workflow.

### Example usage

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  prepare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Openlane CLI
        uses: theopenlane/setup-openlane@v0.0.1
        with:
          version: 'v0.45.10'
          token: ${{ secrets.OPENLANE_TOKEN }}

      - name: Verify installation
        run: |
          openlane version
```

:::note
Replace `v0.0.1` with the appropriate version tag of the action you wish to use

### Inputs

| Input          | Required? | Description                                                                      |
| -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`      | Yes       | The version of the Openlane CLI to install (e.g., `latest`, `v1.2.3`).           |
| `token`        | No        | API or personal access token for the Openlane CLI if authentication is required. |
| `add_to_path`  | No        | Whether to add the CLI to the system `PATH` (default: `true`).                   |


## Best practices

When using the `theopenlane/setup-openlane` action, consider these best practices:

1. **Pin the action version** rather than `@main` to avoid surprises when breaking changes are introduced
1. **Pin the openlane CLI version** input to a specific version for reproducible builds
1. Use [renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) to keep both the action and CLI versions up to date automatically
1. Use **secrets** for tokens (e.g., `secrets.OPENLANE_API_TOKEN`) so you don’t expose credentials in logs
1. To test the setup, **verify** the CLI by running `openlane version` or a small smoke command to ensure it's correctly installed. The `openlane version` does not require authentication so it is a good test command.

## Compatibility & Requirements

* Runs on GitHub Actions runners (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`)
* If you use self-hosted runners, ensure they meet any OS / architecture requirements of the CLI
