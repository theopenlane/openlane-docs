# Impersonation

Openlane supports controlled impersonation for support and admin workflows.

## Purpose

1. Debug tenant-specific issues safely
1. Allow controlled support access without credential sharing
1. Preserve traceability through explicit impersonation claims and audit records

## Core Concepts

1. Impersonation tokens include standard identity claims plus impersonation context
1. Access is scoped and policy-gated
1. Sessions can be explicitly ended to restore normal identity context

## Operational Guidance

1. Limit impersonation permissions to trusted roles
1. Log start/end events and reason codes
1. Monitor impersonation activity in audit trails
