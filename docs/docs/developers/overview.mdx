## Misc

We made an active choice when we started Openlane to be as open and transparent as possible. We believe that the best way to build a secure product is to have as many eyes on it as possible. We also believe that the best way to build a great product is to have as many people contributing to it as possible. We are committed to making Openlane a safe and welcoming space for everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.

As a startup company trying to build a product we can sell, we have limited resources and time - whether it's helping add our documentation, fixing a bug in our code, sponsoring our github project, or subscribing to our paid product, we deeply appreciate your support and contributions. If you're interested in contributing but not sure where to start, feel free to reach out!
