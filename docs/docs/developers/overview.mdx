# Developer Documentation

This documentation is your guide to contributing to and using Openlane. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a curious learner, or a cybersecurity enthusiast, you're in the right place to collaborate and innovate.

All of the founders of Openlane have roots in the open-source community, and we're committed to fostering a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem. We welcome your feedback, contributions, and ideas to make Openlane better for everyone.

Happy coding! 💻

## Misc

We made an active choice when we started Openlane to be as open and transparent as possible. We believe that the best way to build a secure product is to have as many eyes on it as possible. We also believe that the best way to build a great product is to have as many people contributing to it as possible. We are committed to making Openlane a safe and welcoming space for everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.

As a startup company trying to build a product we can sell, we have limited resources and time - whether it's helping add our documentation, fixing a bug in our code, sponsoring our github project, or subscribing to our paid product, we deeply appreciate your support and contributions. If you're interested in contributing but not sure where to start, feel free to reach out!
