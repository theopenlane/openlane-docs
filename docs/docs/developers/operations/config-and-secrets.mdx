# Config and Secrets

Openlane configuration artifacts are generated from Go config structs and deployed through Helm with external secret integration.

## What Is Generated

1. `helm-values.yaml`
1. `config.example.yaml`
1. ConfigMap templates
1. External Secrets templates

## Sensitive Field Handling

Fields tagged as sensitive are split from plain config and mapped to secret references.

## Secret Flow

1. Secret value stored in external secret manager (for example GCP Secret Manager)
1. External Secret resources sync into cluster secrets
1. Application receives values through environment/config injection

## Build Automation Integration

CI workflows detect config changes, regenerate outputs, and create/update infrastructure PRs automatically.
