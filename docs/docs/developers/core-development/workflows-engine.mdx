# Workflows Engine

The workflow engine composes triggers, conditions, and actions into approval and automation flows.

## Core Primitives

1. Trigger: when to evaluate
1. Condition: whether to proceed
1. Action: what to execute
1. Action `when`: action-level gate

## Runtime Model

1. Hook or event determines a candidate workflow definition
1. Engine evaluates trigger and conditions
1. Actions execute in order, with approval actions introducing natural gating
1. Workflow instance state advances through events until completion/failure

## Key Components

1. `internal/workflows/engine` for orchestration and execution
1. `internal/workflows/reconciler` for retries and recovery
1. `internal/workflows/resolvers` for dynamic target resolution
1. `internal/workflows/observability` for telemetry hooks

## Approval Behavior

1. `PRE_COMMIT`: staged proposal behavior before mutation is finalized
1. `POST_COMMIT`: review/automation after mutation is committed

For full architecture and event lifecycle details, refer to `internal/workflows/README.md` in `core`.
