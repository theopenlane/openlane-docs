# Taskfiles and Dev Tools

Openlane repositories use [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) heavily for day-to-day development workflows.

## Why Taskfiles

Taskfiles provide consistent commands for:

1. Testing
1. Linting
1. Code generation
1. Local environment setup

## Common Usage

```bash
task
```

Example output typically includes tasks for linting, testing, generation, and CI helper workflows.

## Frequently Used Tooling

1. `ent` for schema definitions and generated data access
1. `atlas` and `goose` for migration workflows
1. `gqlgen` / `gqlgenc` for GraphQL code generation
1. `openfga` for authorization modeling and checks
1. `redis` and `postgres` for local runtime services
1. `golangci-lint` for static analysis
