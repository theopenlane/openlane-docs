# Project Structure - Core

[Core](https://github.com/theopenlane/core) is the main server for Openlane and where the majority of the backend code and business logic is
located for the API.

## cmd
---

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="server">
        Located in `cmd/` this is a cobra cli that will start up the main core server. The `Taskfile` included in the repo provides the common commands but under the hood
        the `serve` command is what is being used

        ```bash
        go run main.go serve --debug --pretty
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli">
        Located in `cmd/cli/cmd` this directory includes all the CRUD operations for the openlane cli. As these follow a pretty similar pattern throughout
        all objects, there is a template that allows these files to be generated and only requires the input and output fields to be updated.

        :::info
        If you are developing the `cli` or related functionality, instead of using the brew installed cli, you can use:

        ```bash
        go run cmd/cli/main.go [command] [subcommand] <flags>
        ```
        ::: 
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## config
---

Located in `config/` this directory contains the generated config and example settings powered by [koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf).

If changes are made to the config structure or dependent configs, you'll need to regenerate the config:

```bash
task config:generate
```

:::info
The first time you setup the server locally, you'll need to copy the `config/config-dev.example.yaml` into `config/.config.yaml`. This file is 
in the `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing secrets
:::

## internal
----

Located in `internal/ent`, this is the meat of the repo, if you are looking for something, it's probably in this directory somewhere. Everything in the `internal` directory is intended to only be used by packages within this repository, outside usage will be blocked by the go-compiler.

### ent
---
Located in `internal/ent` this directory contains all the code related to the schemas and the interactions with the database

    <TabItem value="schema">
        This include all schemas for the database. When generating a new schema, refer to the [new schema](../ent/create_schema) documentation. 

        When generating a new schema, a template is used that includes the basic structure of any new schema used in Openlane
        ```go
            package schema

            import (
                "entgo.io/contrib/entgql"

                }
            }

            // Mixin of the Meow
            func (Meow) Mixin() []ent.Mixin {
                return []ent.Mixin{
                    emixin.AuditMixin{},
                    emixin.IDMixin{},

                    emixin.TagMixin{},
                }
            }

            func (Meow) Edges() []ent.Edge {
                return []ent.Edge{
                    // Edges go here

                    entgql.Mutations(entgql.MutationCreate(), (entgql.MutationUpdate())),

                    // the above annotations create all the graphQL goodness; if you need the schema only and not the endpoints, use the below annotation instead
                    // if you do not need the graphql bits, also be certain to add an exclusion to scripts/files_to_skip.txt
                    // entgql.Skip(entgql.SkipAll),

                    // the below annotation adds the entfga policy that will check access to the entity
                    // remove this annotation (or replace with another policy) if you want checks to be defined
                    // by another object

                return policy.NewPolicy(
                    policy.WithQueryRules(
                        // add query rules here, the below is the recommended default

                    ),
                    policy.WithMutationRules(
                        // add mutation rules here, the below is the recommended default
                        policy.CheckCreateAccess(),
                        entfga.CheckEditAccess[*generated.MeowMutation](),
                    ),
                )
            }
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="hooks">
        This contains all `hooks` written to change the behavior of a mutation. Think of a hook as a middleware that can occur before or after the mutation is executed.

        ```go
        // HookExample is a hook that is used as an example that only happens on `Create` operations
        func HookExample() ent.Hook {
            return hook.On(func(next ent.Mutator) ent.Mutator {
                return hook.ExampleFunc(func(ctx context.Context, m *generated.ExampleMutation) (generated.Value, error) {
                    // code here will occur before the example mutation is executed

                    retVal, err := next.Mutate(ctx, m)
                    if err != nil {
                        return nil, err
                    }

                    // code here will occur after the example mutation is executed

                    return retVal, err
                })
            }, ent.OpCreate) // only do the thing on create operations, this can be omitted completely or include multiple operations separated by `|`
        }
        ```

        For more information, refer to the upstream [docs](https://entgo.io/docs/hooks/)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="interceptors">
        This contains all `interceptors` written to change the behavior of a query. These are similar to hooks, but instead of acting on a mutation, it acts on a query.

        - `Traverse` functions occur before the query is executed
        - `Interceptor` functions occur after the query is executed

        We commonly use these to filter data the user has access to, or log information such as query timing, for example: 

        ```go
            func QueryLogger() ent.InterceptFunc {
                return func(next ent.Querier) ent.Querier {
                    return ent.QuerierFunc(func(ctx context.Context, query generated.Query) (ent.Value, error) {
                        q, err := intercept.NewQuery(query)
                        if err != nil {
                            return nil, err
                        }

                        start := time.Now()
                        defer func() {
                            log.Info().
                                Str("duration", time.Since(start).String()).
                                Str("schema", q.Type()).
                                Msg("query duration")
                        }()

                        return next.Query(ctx, query)
                    })
                }
            }
        ```

        For more information, refer to the upstream [docs](https://entgo.io/docs/interceptors)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="privacy">
        This includes privacy policies, this is used in conjunction with our FGA implementation

        For more information, refer to the upstream [docs](https://entgo.io/docs/privacy)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mixin">
        Mixins are common fields and functions that are used on multiple schemas, for example, the `SoftDeleteMixin` is used on all schemas as we want to use soft-deletes
        across all our database tables.

        :::note
        not **all** mixins are here. Due to import cycles, some are located within the `schema` directory. Others, because they are not unique to this repository are located within the [entx](https://github.com/theopenlane/entx/tree/main/mixin) repository
        :::
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="generated">
        All code generated by `entc` is in this directory and should not be edited manually as changes will be overwritten on the next run of `task generate`.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### graphapi
---
Located in `internal/graphapi` this directory contains all the code related to graphapi resolvers,

All graphapi resolvers require authentication, this is handled by the auth middleware and requires no updates to the resolvers themselves.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="structure">
        ```bash
        ├── internal
        │   ├── graphapi
        │   │   ├── clientschema
        │   │   ├── generate
        │   │   ├── generated
        │   │   ├── model
        │   │   ├── query
        │   │   ├── schema
        │   │   └── testdata
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="resolvers">
        The `*.resolvers.go` files contain the business logic of the resolvers. 
        These are generated based on the schema and a template, but the generated should be reviewed and updated as needed depending on the use case.

        All of the list functions are included in `ent.resolvers.go`, whereas the `CRUD` functions are in a file per schema. For example, the `group` schema 
        resolvers will be located in `group.resolvers.go.`
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="query">
        The `internal/graphapi/query` directory contains queries and mutations used to generate the `openlaneclient` using [gqlgenc](https://github.com/Yamashou/gqlgenc)

        :::info
        Basic queries are generated as part of the gqlgen process, however, these only include direct fields and no edges. These are **not** regenerated after
        each run to preserve manual changes. 
        :::
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="schema">
        The `internal/graphapi/schema` directory contains the generated graphql schemas. 

        You can add manually created schemas here for additional functionality. As an example the `programextended.graphql` contains extended schemas such as:

        ```graphql
            extend input UpdateProgramInput {
                addProgramMembers: [CreateProgramMembershipInput!]
            }

            extend input ProgramMembershipWhereInput {
                programID: String
                userID: String
            }
        ```

        :::info
        Schemas are generated as part of the gqlgen process. These are **not** regenerated after each run to preserve manual changes with the exception of 
        `ent.graphql` which is fully generated.
        :::
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="generated">
     All the generated functions are included in the `internal/graphapi/generated` directory, with a file per schema. 

     The generated models are included in the `internal/graphapi/model/gen_model.go`. 

     The files in both of these directories are not intended for manual changes, and instead should only be updated the the generation scripts. 

     The `generate` directory contains the config and generation scripts for the graphapi related generation (`gqlgen` and `gqlgenc`)
     </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### httpserve
---
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="server">
        Located in `internal/httpserve` this directory contains the main http server and configuration as well as the `REST` api handlers and routes. Although the
        majority of the openlane API is a graphapi, there are several `REST` routes such as `login`, `password-reset`, etc.

        ```
        ├── internal
        │   ├── httpserve
        │   │   ├── authmanager
        │   │   ├── config
        │   │   ├── handlers
        │   │   ├── route
        │   │   ├── server
        │   │   └── serveropts
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="handlers">
        Located in `internal/httpserve/handlers` this directory contains the `REST` api handlers. The general use-case should not require a REST endpoint, however, there are several cases where REST handlers have
        been implemented such as for `login`. Handlers should all follow the same pattern of created a Handler and a BindHandler, for openAPI specs.

        ```go
        func (h *Handler) ExampleHandler(ctx echo.Context) error {
            // bind the input
            var in models.ExampleRequest
            if err := ctx.Bind(&in); err != nil {
                return h.InvalidInput(ctx, err)
            }

            // validate the input
            if err := in.Validate(); err != nil {
                return h.InvalidInput(ctx, err)
            }

            //
            // ... do some stuff ...
            //


            // return the response
            out := models.ExampleReply{
                Reply:    rout.Reply{Success: true},
                Message:  "success",
            }

            return h.Success(ctx, out)
        }

        // BindExampleHandler binds the example request to the OpenAPI schema
        func (h *Handler) BindExampleHandler() *openapi3.Operation {
            example := openapi3.NewOperation()
            example.Description = "Example is ... "
            example.Tags = []string{"example"}
            example.OperationID = "ExampleHandler"

            h.AddRequestBody("ExampleRequest", models.ExampleExampleSuccessRequest, example)
            h.AddResponse("ExampleReply", "success", models.ExampleExampleSuccessResponse, example, http.StatusOK)
            example.AddResponse(http.StatusInternalServerError, internalServerError())
            example.AddResponse(http.StatusBadRequest, badRequest())

            return example
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="routes">
        Located in `internal/httpserve/route` this directory contains all the http routes for the server. 
        All handlers must be registered routes with the `echo` server. Once a handler is created, a route should be added here. These all follow a predictable pattern

        ```go
        func registerExampleHandler(router *Router) (err error) {
            path := "/example"
            method := http.MethodPost
            name := "Example"

            route := echo.Route{
                Name:        name,
                Method:      method,
                Path:        path,
                Middlewares: mw,
                Handler: func(c echo.Context) error {
                    return router.Handler.ExampleHandler(c)
                },
            }

            op := router.Handler.BindExampleHandler()

            if err := router.Addv1Route(path, method, op, route); err != nil {
                return err
            }

            return nil
        }
        ```
        :::info
        The default middleware (`mw`) is an unauthenticated route. If the REST endpoint should require authentication `authMW` should be used instead.
        :::
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="server opts">
        This contains server options for the echo server, including `With` options for setting up different settings. 
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## pkg

### middleware

Located in `pkg/middleware` this contains many commonly used `middleware` used by the core server.

:::note
These may move to internal if they are dependent on the schema,
or to another repo at some point in the future.
:::

```
├── pkg
│   ├── middleware
│   │   ├── auth

│   │   └── transaction
```

### models

Located in `pkg/models` this includes all the model information for the `REST` api input and output. This is used to generate our openAPI specs.

All REST endpoints should include an entry in the `models` package with:

- `Request` - the fields, noting `omitempty` if not required, that should be included with the `POST` request
- `Reply`  - the fields included in a response from the handler
- `Validate` Request function - validation function for the `Request`
- `ExampleSuccessRequest` - example request containing valid values for the fields
- `ExampleSuccessReply` - example response that would be returned on a successful request

### openlaneclient

Located in `pkg/openlaneclient` this includes the generated golang API client used to interact with the API. The queries added to `internal/graphapi/query`
are used as input to `gqlgenc` for the graphclient. The restclient is manually maintained.
