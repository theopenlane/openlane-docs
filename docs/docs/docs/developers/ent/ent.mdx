# Schema Driven Development with Ent

[Ent](https://entgo.io/docs/getting-started) is a powerful, Go-based entity framework that emphasizes schema-driven development.
This approach allows developers to define the structure and relationships of their data in a centralized schema, 
written in Go code, which then generates all the necessary boilerplate for database interactions.

## Key Features
1. **Schema as Code**: Define your database schema in Go, enabling type safety and integration with the rest of your codebase
1. **Automatic Code Generation**: Generate CRUD operations, query builders, and schema migrations
1. **Built-In Migration System**: Manage database schema changes with ease
1. **Relationships**: Define and manage complex relationships between entities, such as one-to-many and many-to-many
1. **Extensibility**: Add hooks, middlewares, and custom fields to extend functionality

## Creating a New Schema

Workflow of generating a new schema and related CRUD resolvers

### Create a new schema file
    ```bash
    task db:newschema -- MyNewSchema
    ```
### Update new templated schema
    The file will be located in `internal/ent/schema/`, the file name matching the schema name
    1. Add [Fields](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-fields) to the schema
    1. Add [Edges](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-edges) to the schema for 1:1, 1:m, or m:m relationships with other objects
    1. Add [Indexes](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-indexes) to the schema. A common use in our codebase is to add an index to allow soft-deleted names to be reused even when the name is required to be unique. 
        ```go
        index.Fields("name").
			Unique().Annotations(entsql.IndexWhere("deleted_at is NULL")),
        ```
    1. Review and update the [Annotations](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-annotations) on the templated schema
    1. Add [Hooks](https://entgo.io/docs/hooks/) for use on mutations, these act as middleware that can happen before or after the request is executed
    1. Add [Interceptors](https://entgo.io/docs/interceptors) for use on queries, these act as middleware that can happen before or after the request is executed, commonly used to filter data
    1. Review and update the [Privacy](https://entgo.io/docs/privacy) policy on the templated schema

### Generate the CRUD resolvers
    ```bash
    task generate
    ```

    This will take a few minutes to run the first time, the main generation that will happen:
    1. **entc** - ORM functions for the object
    1. **gqlgen** - graphapi resolvers and basic query generation
    1. **gqlgenc** - golang api client based on queries

### Generate the Migrations 
    This will generate the goose and atlas migrations based on the ent schema changes
    ```bash
    task db:create
    ```
### Stub out the CRUD cli commands
    ```bash
    task cli:generate
    ```
    The cli flags for create and update, along with field output (in `root.go`) will need to be manually updated
