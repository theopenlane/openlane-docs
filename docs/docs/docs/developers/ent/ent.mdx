# Schema Driven Development with Ent

[Ent](https://entgo.io/docs/getting-started) is a powerful, Go-based entity framework that emphasizes schema-driven development.
This approach allows developers to define the structure and relationships of their data in a centralized schema,
written in Go code, which then generates all the necessary boilerplate for database interactions.

## Key Features
1. **Schema as Code**: Define your database schema in Go, enabling type safety and integration with the rest of your codebase
1. **Automatic Code Generation**: Generate CRUD operations, query builders, and schema migrations
1. **Built-In Migration System**: Manage database schema changes with ease
1. **Relationships**: Define and manage complex relationships between entities, such as one-to-many and many-to-many
1. **Extensibility**: Add hooks, middlewares, and custom fields to extend functionality
