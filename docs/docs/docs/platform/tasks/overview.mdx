# Overview

Tasks are just like how they sound - individual pieces of work that can be assigned to users and created either directly from the Tasks page, or from other objects within the Openlane system. A task could be assigned as a part of proposed changes to a policy or procedure, created as a part of a program, associated to objects and assigned a user, due date, and other attributes.

The overarching goal of Tasks within Openlane is to reduce or eliminate the need for the use of manual tracking or additional external systems to manage work related to managing a comprehensive security and compliance program within your business.
