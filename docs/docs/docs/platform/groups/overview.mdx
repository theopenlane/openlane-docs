# Groups

Groups provide a mechanism for organizing users, managing permissions, and implementing role-based access control (RBAC) within Openlane's compliance management platform.

Groups in this system are entities that manage collections of users and control their permissions across various objects such as programs, controls, internal policies, and more. Groups can have different roles and permissions, which dictate what actions their members can perform on these objects.

## What Are Groups?

Groups are collections of users with shared responsibilities, permissions, or organizational functions. They enable efficient management of access controls, assignment of compliance tasks, and coordination of compliance activities across teams and departments.

## Compliance Significance

Groups are essential for:

- **Access Control**: Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) for compliance systems
- **Segregation of Duties**: Ensuring proper separation of responsibilities in compliance processes
- **Audit Trail**: Tracking group-based permissions and access for compliance auditing
- **Organizational Structure**: Mapping compliance responsibilities to organizational units
- **Workflow Management**: Enabling group-based task assignment and collaboration

## Group Types

### Functional Groups

- **Purpose**: Groups based on job functions or expertise areas
- **Examples**: Security Team, Compliance Officers, IT Administrators
- **Permissions**: Role-specific access to relevant compliance objects
- **Responsibilities**: Functional compliance activities and oversight

### Organizational Groups

- **Purpose**: Groups based on organizational structure
- **Examples**: Regional Teams, Department Groups, Business Units
- **Permissions**: Organization-level access to relevant entities and programs
- **Responsibilities**: Entity-specific compliance activities

### Project Groups

- **Purpose**: Temporary groups for specific compliance projects
- **Examples**: SOC 2 Audit Team, Risk Assessment Team, Implementation Team
- **Permissions**: Project-specific access to relevant objects and evidence
- **Responsibilities**: Project deliverables and compliance milestones

### Approval Groups

- **Purpose**: Groups with approval authority for compliance activities
- **Examples**: Risk Committee, Compliance Committee, Executive Team
- **Permissions**: Approval rights for policies, risk assessments, and remediation plans
- **Responsibilities**: Governance and approval of compliance decisions

## Properties

### Core Information

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the group
- **Name**: Descriptive name for the group
- **Display Name**: User-friendly display name
- **Description**: Purpose and scope of the group
- **Group Type**: Classification of the group (functional, organizational, etc.)

### Configuration

- **Settings**: Group configuration options and preferences
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained permissions and access controls
- **Visibility**: Group visibility and discoverability settings

- **Membership History**: Audit trail of membership changes

### Organizational Context

- **Organization**: Parent organization that owns the group
- **Parent Groups**: Hierarchical relationship to parent groups
- **Child Groups**: Subordinate groups under this group
- **Related Entities**: Associated business entities or departments

## GraphQL Operations

### Query Groups
```graphql
query GetGroups($first: Int, $where: GroupWhereInput) {
  groups(first: $first, where: $where) {
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
      endCursor
    }
    totalCount
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        displayID
        description
        settings {
          visibility
          joinPolicy
        }
        members {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              user {
                id
                firstName
                lastName
                email
              }
              role
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Create Group
```graphql
mutation CreateGroup($input: CreateGroupInput!) {
  createGroup(input: $input) {
    group {
      id
      name
      displayID
      description
      settings {
        visibility
        joinPolicy
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Add Group Member
```graphql
mutation CreateGroupMembership($input: CreateGroupMembershipInput!) {
  createGroupMembership(input: $input) {
    groupMembership {
      id
      role
      user {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        email
      }
      group {
        id
        name
        displayID
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Update Group
```graphql
mutation UpdateGroup($id: ID!, $input: UpdateGroupInput!) {
  updateGroup(id: $id, input: $input) {
    group {
      id
      name
      displayID
      description
      settings {
        visibility
        joinPolicy
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating Groups

Groups can be created in several ways:

* Basic Creation: Using the `createGroup` mutation.
* With Members: Using the `createGroupWithMembers` mutation, which allows specifying members at the time of creation.
* By Cloning: Using the `createGroupByClone` mutation, which allows creating a new group by cloning the permissions and/or members of an existing group.

### Example Mutation for Basic Creation

```graphql
mutation CreateGroup($input: CreateGroupInput!) {
  createGroup(input: $input) {
    group {
      id
      name
      displayName
      owner {
        id
        displayName
      }
      setting {
        id
        joinPolicy
        syncToGithub
        syncToSlack
        visibility
      }
      permissions {
        id
        objectType
        permissions
      }
      members {
        id
        role
        user {
          id
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating Groups

Groups can be updated using the `updateGroup` mutation. This mutation allows modifying various attributes of the group, including its name, description, and settings. Additionally, it supports adding or removing members and inheriting permissions from another group.

### Example Mutation for Updating a Group

```graphql
mutation UpdateGroup($id: ID!, $input: UpdateGroupInput!) {
  updateGroup(id: $id, input: $input) {
    group {
      id
      name
      displayName
      description
      setting {
        id
        joinPolicy
        syncToGithub
        syncToSlack
        visibility
      }
      permissions {
        id
        objectType
        permissions
      }
      members {
        id
        role
        user {
          id
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## API Access

Groups are managed exclusively through GraphQL operations. There are no REST endpoints for group CRUD operations. All group management, membership, and permission operations must be performed using the GraphQL API as shown in the examples above.

## Group Permissions and Access Control

### Permission Types

Common permission types for compliance groups include object-level permissions for controls, evidence, risks, policies, and programs, as well as system-level permissions for administration and organization management.

### Role-Based Permission Templates
```yaml
# Permission templates for common compliance roles
roles:
  compliance_officer:
    permissions:
      - object: "control"
        relations: ["can_view", "can_edit", "can_approve"]
      - object: "evidence"
        relations: ["can_view", "can_upload", "can_edit"]
      - object: "risk"
        relations: ["can_view", "can_assess", "can_edit"]
      - object: "policy"
        relations: ["can_view", "can_edit", "can_approve"]

  auditor:
    permissions:
      - object: "control"
        relations: ["can_view"]
      - object: "evidence"
        relations: ["can_view", "can_download"]
      - object: "risk"
        relations: ["can_view"]
      - object: "program"
        relations: ["can_audit"]

  security_admin:
    permissions:
      - object: "control"
        relations: ["can_view", "can_edit", "can_delete"]
      - object: "evidence"
        relations: ["can_view", "can_upload", "can_edit", "can_delete"]
      - object: "scan"
        relations: ["can_view", "can_execute", "can_configure"]
```

## Group Workflows

### Compliance Team Setup

Compliance team setup involves creating a main compliance group with full access permissions, followed by specialized subgroups for specific functions like audit coordination and risk management.

### Project-Based Group Management

Project-specific compliance groups can be created with appropriate settings including visibility controls, join policies, and automatic archiving based on project duration.

### Dynamic Permission Management

Group permissions can be dynamically updated based on compliance requirements using GraphQL mutations to modify group settings, permissions, and effective dates.

## Group Membership Management

### Membership Lifecycle

Group membership lifecycle management includes adding members with specific roles, removing members when needed, and updating member roles using GraphQL mutations for group membership operations.

### Bulk Membership Operations

Bulk membership management enables efficient addition of multiple users to groups with specific roles using iterative GraphQL mutation calls for large team management.

## Relationships

Groups integrate with several other Openlane objects:

### Direct Relationships
- **Organization**: Groups belong to organizations
- **Group Membership**: Links users to groups with specific roles
- **Group Settings**: Configuration and preferences for groups
- **Group Permissions**: Fine-grained access controls for groups

### Indirect Relationships
- **Users**: Group members who participate in compliance activities
- **Controls**: Groups may have specific permissions for control management
- **Evidence**: Groups may be responsible for evidence collection and review
- **Risks**: Groups may be assigned risk assessment and management responsibilities
- **Tasks**: Groups can be assigned compliance tasks and activities
- **Programs**: Groups may be responsible for specific compliance programs
