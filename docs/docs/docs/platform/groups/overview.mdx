# Overview

Groups in this system are entities that manage collections of users and control their permissions across various objects such as programs, controls, internal policies, and more. Groups can have different roles and permissions, which dictate what actions their members can perform on these objects.

## Creating Groups

Groups can be created in several ways:

* Basic Creation: Using the `createGroup` mutation.
* With Members: Using the `createGroupWithMembers` mutation, which allows specifying members at the time of creation.
* By Cloning: Using the `createGroupByClone` mutation, which allows creating a new group by cloning the permissions and/or members of an existing group.

### Example Mutation for Basic Creation

```graphql
mutation CreateGroup($input: CreateGroupInput!) {
  createGroup(input: $input) {
    group {
      id
      name
      displayName
      owner {
        id
        displayName
      }
      setting {
        id
        joinPolicy
        syncToGithub
        syncToSlack
        visibility
      }
      permissions {
        id
        objectType
        permissions
      }
      members {
        id
        role
        user {
          id
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating Groups

Groups can be updated using the `updateGroup` mutation. This mutation allows modifying various attributes of the group, including its name, description, and settings. Additionally, it supports adding or removing members and inheriting permissions from another group.

### Example Mutation for Updating a Group

```graphql
mutation UpdateGroup($id: ID!, $input: UpdateGroupInput!) {
  updateGroup(id: $id, input: $input) {
    group {
      id
      name
      displayName
      description
      setting {
        id
        joinPolicy
        syncToGithub
        syncToSlack
        visibility
      }
      permissions {
        id
        objectType
        permissions
      }
      members {
        id
        role
        user {
          id
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
