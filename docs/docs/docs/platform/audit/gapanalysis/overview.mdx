# Overview

A gap analysis is a process used to identify and assess your organization’s state of compliance with national, global, and industry-specific regulations and standards. It can help you identify gaps in policies, procedures, communication, and training, highlighting potential risk areas within your organization. Doing a gap analysis is critical to ensuring your organization remains compliant, no matter what industry or geography your organization operates in.

## When do you need to do a gap analysis?

A gap analysis is something you need to undertake regularly at an organizational level. Often this is something that is done on a quarterly or annual basis, depending on the regulatory complexity of the industry your organization operates in. There are also several instances where you may need to do a one-off gap analysis. These include the following.

- Regulatory changes
    - Regulation changes all the time. Take, for instance, the EU’s 2022 Digital Operational Resilience Act—or the annual regulatory amendments to HIPAA and OSHA in the U.S.
    - When new legislation or amendments come into force, it’s important to undergo a gap analysis to identify whether your current organizational policies and procedures meet these new regulations.
- After risk assessments
    - A risk assessment identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities but doesn’t necessarily offer specific guidance on addressing them.
    - A gap analysis, conducted post-assessment, bridges this gap by outlining the differences between your current practices and the controls needed to mitigate identified risks.
    - Doing a gap analysis provides actionable insights that allow you to prioritize interventions and target resources towards the most significant weaknesses.
- During internal audits
    - Conducting a gap analysis during an internal audit serves several crucial purposes that enhance the effectiveness and value of the audit.
    - It helps you narrow the focus on high-risk areas. It can help you uncover hidden vulnerabilities. In turn, it helps you focus strategically on the areas that matter most.
- When you start a new role
    - When you move to a different organization, or even to a different line of business, it’s important that you undergo an organizational gap analysis so that you can set a baseline and identify potential gaps and risks.
    - It will also help you align compliance against wider business goals, and ultimately, get a better understanding of the organization’s compliance status quo.

## How to do a gap analysis

The key steps involved in a gap analysis are as follows.

1. Identify the scope of your gap analysis
    1. Which regulations or standards are you targeting? This could be anything from industry-specific frameworks like HIPAA and OSHA to broader ethical guidelines like ISO 26000.
    1. What areas of your organization will be assessed? Focus on departments, processes, or systems relevant to the chosen regulations.
1. Compare existing policies against compliance requirements
    1. Analyze the inconsistencies between your current practices and the required controls. These are your “compliance gaps.”
    1. Prioritize the identified gaps based on their potential impact and risk severity. Consider factors like financial penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruptions.
1. Build a plan to address the compliance gaps
    1. For the gaps you’ve identified, create a specific action plan: What needs to be implemented or improved to achieve compliance?
    1. Set clear timelines, assign responsibilities, and allocate resources for each action item.
    1. Prioritize critical actions based on the severity of the risks.
1. Track the progress of your compliance program
    1. Conduct regular reviews and audits to assess the effectiveness of your implemented controls and adherence to regulations.
    1. Be prepared to adapt your action plan based on ongoing monitoring and changes in the regulatory landscape.

## The benefits of doing a gap analysis

The clearest benefit of doing a gap analysis is that it will help your organization mitigate risk and become more compliant.

There are also several other benefits. These include:

**Prioritized compliance efforts**
A thorough gap analysis prioritizes compliance efforts by revealing the severity and impact of each gap. Understanding the impact of gaps guides compliance leaders to focus resources on the most pressing compliance needs.

**Proactive risk mitigation**
Compliance gap analysis identifies risks hidden in your processes, letting you shield yourself from financial, legal, operational, and reputational damage.

**Cost savings**
Conducting a gap analysis allows for the strategic allocation of resources to ensure compliance, including personnel, technologies, and other essential investments. This approach not only guarantees regulatory adherence but also results in cost savings over time by preventing scrutiny and legal penalties associated with non-compliance.

**More efficient processes**
By identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities, gap analysis enables streamlined workflows and easier navigation of compliance challenges. This empowers organizations to refine policies, update SOPs, and strengthen internal controls.
