# Controls

A Control in the context of Openlane is a security measure that is put in place to mitigate risk. Controls can be either preventative or detective in nature.

## Control Types

| **Control Type** | **Description** |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Preventative     | Preventative controls are designed to prevent security incidents from occurring. Examples include firewalls, access controls, and encryption. |
| Detective        | Detective controls are designed to detect security incidents that have already occurred. Examples include intrusion detection systems, log monitoring, and security audits. |

## Control Categories

| **Control Category** | **Description** |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| Administrative         | Administrative controls are policies, procedures, and guidelines that are put in place to manage security risks. Examples include security training, incident response plans, and access control policies. |
| Technical             | Technical controls are hardware and software solutions that are put in place to manage security risks. Examples include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption. |
| Physical              | Physical controls are measures that are put in place to protect physical assets. Examples include security cameras, access control systems, and security guards. |


## Control Frameworks

Control frameworks are sets of guidelines and best practices that organizations can use to manage their security risks. Examples include the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, and the CIS Controls.

## Control Objectives

Control objectives are the specific goals that an organization wants to achieve with its security controls. Examples include protecting sensitive data, ensuring business continuity, and complying with regulatory requirements.

## Control Implementation

Control implementation is the process of putting security controls in place. This can involve selecting and configuring hardware and software solutions, developing policies and procedures, and providing training to employees.

## Control Monitoring

Control monitoring is the process of regularly reviewing and assessing the effectiveness of security controls. This can involve conducting security audits, reviewing log files, and testing incident response plans.

## Control Testing

Control testing is the process of evaluating the effectiveness of security controls. This can involve conducting penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and social engineering tests.
