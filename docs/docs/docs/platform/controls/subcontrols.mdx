# Subcontrols

Subcontrols are granular components or sub-requirements within larger compliance controls that provide detailed, specific requirements for achieving control objectives.

## What Are Subcontrols?

Subcontrols break down complex controls into smaller, more manageable components that can be implemented, tested, and verified independently. They provide detailed specifications for control implementation while maintaining the hierarchical relationship to their parent control.

## Compliance Significance

Subcontrols are essential for:

- **Granular Implementation**: Breaking complex controls into manageable implementation units
- **Detailed Testing**: Enabling specific testing of individual control components
- **Precise Mapping**: Mapping specific requirements to implementation activities
- **Audit Granularity**: Providing detailed audit trails for control components
- **Risk Mitigation**: Addressing specific risk scenarios within broader control objectives

## Subcontrol Categories

### Technical Subcontrols

- **Purpose**: Specific technical implementation requirements
- **Examples**: Encryption algorithms, access control mechanisms, logging requirements
- **Implementation**: Technical configuration and system settings
- **Verification**: Automated testing and technical validation

### Administrative Subcontrols

- **Purpose**: Process and procedure requirements
- **Examples**: Approval workflows, documentation requirements, training mandates
- **Implementation**: Policy development and process implementation
- **Verification**: Process audits and compliance checks

### Physical Subcontrols

- **Purpose**: Physical security and environmental requirements
- **Examples**: Access controls, environmental monitoring, equipment protection
- **Implementation**: Physical security measures and controls
- **Verification**: Physical inspections and monitoring

### Operational Subcontrols

- **Purpose**: Ongoing operational requirements
- **Examples**: Monitoring procedures, maintenance activities, incident response
- **Implementation**: Operational procedures and workflows
- **Verification**: Operational audits and performance monitoring

## Properties

### Core Information

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the subcontrol
- **Reference Code**: Specific reference code for the subcontrol
- **Name**: Descriptive name of the subcontrol
- **Description**: Detailed description of the subcontrol requirement
- **Control ID**: Parent control this subcontrol belongs to

### Implementation Details

- **Implementation Type**: Technical, administrative, physical, or operational
- **Implementation Priority**: Priority level for implementation
- **Implementation Status**: Current status of implementation
- **Implementation Date**: When the subcontrol was implemented

### Verification and Testing

- **Verification Method**: How the subcontrol is verified
- **Test Frequency**: How often the subcontrol should be tested
- **Last Verification**: Date of most recent verification
- **Verification Results**: Results from the latest verification
