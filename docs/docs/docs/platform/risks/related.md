Risk management is foundational to effective compliance programs. Risks connect with virtually every other aspect of compliance management, driving control selection, evidence collection, and program priorities.

## Primary Relationships

### Controls

Controls are implemented to mitigate specific risks and reduce their likelihood or impact.

- **[Controls Overview](../controls/overview.mdx)** - Controls that address identified risks
- **[Control Creation](../controls/create.mdx)** - Implementing risk-driven controls

### Action Plans

Action plans define specific steps to address and mitigate identified risks.

- **[Action Plans Overview](../programs/actionplans/overview.mdx)** - Risk mitigation planning
- **[Action Plan Creation](../programs/actionplans/create.mdx)** - Creating risk treatment plans

### Programs

Risks are managed within the context of compliance programs and their objectives.

- **[Programs Overview](../programs/overview.mdx)** - Program-level risk management
