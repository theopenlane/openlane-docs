# Overview

There are many bodies of thought and frameworks for how to create and define risks, which you can find in the [Risk Frameworks](riskmanagement.mdx) section. Regardless of what framework you choose, Openlane's risk definitions and structure is relatively simple and flexible.

We realize that we cannot accommodate every risk framework and strategy, so we have created a simple and flexible risk management system that can be adapted to your needs.

## What is Risk Management?

Risk management is the process of identifying all of the various risks your organization faces and finding ways to either control and mitigate any potential adverse effects they could have on your organization or leverage and exploit them to generate strategic advantage.

Risk management looks a little different at every organization, but it typically follows this general framework:

1. Identify your risks: Paint a complete picture of all of the risks your organization faces. This can be done through data analysis, stakeholder interviews, review of external media and global trends, and other methods. Use this research to build a list of all your organization risks, known as a risk register.

1. Assess your risks: For each risk in your risk register, measure the potential impact it could have on your business if it were to turn into a risk event. You can use qualitative methods, quantitative methods, or both to accomplish this.

1. Prioritize your risks: Rank your risks in order of their potential business impact.

1. Mitigate or exploit your risks: Using your ranked list, begin exploring ways to either mitigate your risks or, if appropriate, exploit them to drive growth.

1. Monitor the results: Keep a continuous eye on how your mitigation efforts or risk exploitation strategies are performing, and adjust as needed.

Rinse and repeat: Risk management is a marathon, not a sprint. Repeat this process on a regular, ongoing basis.
