# Risk Management Frameworks (RMF)

A risk management framework describes the vocabulary, tools and techniques for a coherent approach and ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page.

Enterprise frameworks identifies _any type of risk_ that could prevent the company from achieving its business objectives while others focus on information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection.

## COSO Enterprise Risk Management

The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission [(COSO)](https://www.coso.org) help organizations improve internal control with the [ERM Framework (2020)](https://www.coso.org/Documents/Compliance-Risk-Management-Applying-the-COSO-ERM-Framework.pdf).

## Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)

[Fair](https://www.fairinstitute.org/) is a quantitative model for information security and operational risk.

## International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

[ISO/IEC 27005:2022
Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection — Guidance on managing information security risks](https://www.iso.org/standard/80585.html) provides guidelines to managing _information security risks_ faced by organizations. The application of these guidelines can be applied to an Information Security Management System (ISMS) specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002.

A technical committee named [ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27](https://www.iso.org/committee/45306.html) focus on the development of standards for the protection of information and ICT.

[ISO 31000](https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html) provides a common approach to managing _any type of risk_ faced by organizations. The application of these guidelines can be customized to any organization and its context.

The ISO 31000 Risk Management umbrella include some specifications still under development:
ISO 31000:2018
Risk management — Guidelines
 * [ISO 31000 Risk management – Guidelines](https://www.iso.org/standard/65694.html)
 * [ISO 31000:2019 Risk Management – Risk Assessment Techniques](https://www.iso.org/standard/72140.html)
 * [ISO 31022:2020 Risk Management — Guidelines for the management of legal risk](https://www.iso.org/standard/69295.html)
 * [ISO/FDIS 31030 Travel Risk Management — Guidance for organizations](https://www.iso.org/standard/54204.html)
 * [ISO/AWI 31050 – Guidance for managing emerging risks to enhance resilience](https://www.iso.org/standard/54224.html)
 * [ISO/DIS 31073 Risk Management – Vocabulary](https://www.iso.org/standard/79637.html)

A technical committee named[ISO/TC 262](https://www.iso.org/committee/629121.html) focus on the development of standards in the field of risk management. Visit the Technical Committee's own [website](https://committee.iso.org/home/tc262) for more information.

## NIST

The [NIST Risk Management Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management) provides a process that integrates security, privacy and risk management activities into the system development life cycle to meet the requirements of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act [(FISMA)](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act).

Note that [NIST Special Publications 800-53 revision 5](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) describe the Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations and the [special publication 800-53*B*](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53B.pdf) describe the control baselines.

## Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)

The [OCTAVE method](http://www.cert.org/octave) was developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University on behalf of the Department of Defense.

## Rapid Risk Assessment

The [Rapid Risk Analysis (RRA) methodology](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/risk/rapid_risk_assessment.html) developed by Mozilla helps formalize decisions in 60 minutes.

## Threat Agent Risk Assessment (TARA)

[Threat Assessment and Remediation Analysis (TARA)](https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/threat-assessment-and-remediation-analysis-tara) is an engineering methodology used to identify and assess cyber vulnerabilities and select countermeasures effective at mitigating those vulnerabilities. TARA is part of a MITRE portfolio of systems security engineering (SSE) practices.
