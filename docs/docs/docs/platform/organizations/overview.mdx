# Organizations

Organizations represent the fundamental tenant structure in Openlane, serving as the primary container for all compliance activities, resources, and data within the platform. The `Organization` object represents a central entity within the system, encapsulating various resources, settings, and members.

## What Are Organizations?

Organizations are the top-level entities in Openlane's multi-tenant architecture. They provide complete data isolation, resource management, and compliance program coordination for distinct business entities, companies, or organizational units.

## Resource Ownership

Organizations are the holders / owners of resources created within the tenancy model, but a confirmed user in active state must be associated with the Organization ownership role. A user will always be the owner of their Personal Organization, they will very commonly be members of Organizations other than their Personal, and they will likely be the owner of other Organizations or Child Organizations depending on desired system configuration(s).

## Membership

Users will hold "memberships" to objects such as Groups, Organizations, Projects, etc. They will also hold ownership of resources which is the assignment of a role-level within openlane's authorization constructs, as the "parent" of resources within openlane are always the tenant(s) of the associated tree.

## Personal Organizations

After being created, a user can be granted access to a tenant, which allows them to perform operations and access resources within that tenant and all its sub-tenants. Users can be granted access to one or more tenants, as needed, and can be managed through the user and permissions APIs exposed / provided by openlane.

## Permissions at an Organization Level

Permissions within an organization are managed through roles and specific permissions:

- Roles: Roles such as `owner`, `admin`, `member` define the level of access a user has within an organization.
- Permissions: Specific permissions like `can_view`, `can_edit`, `audit_log_viewer`, and `can_invite_members` are assigned to roles to control access to various resources and actions within the organization.

### Organization Membership

Organization membership involves associating users with an organization and assigning them roles. Membership details include:

- Roles: Roles assigned to members determine their access level and permissions within the organization.
- Membership Management: Members can be added, updated, or removed using mutations like `createOrgMembership`, `updateOrgMembership`, and `deleteOrgMembership`.

### Update Organization roles

Example:

```graphql
mutation UpdateUserRoleInOrg($updateOrgMemberId: ID!, $input: UpdateOrgMembershipInput!) {
  updateOrgMembership(id: $updateOrgMemberId, input: $input) {
    orgMembership {
      id
      role
      userID
      organizationID
    }
  }
}
```

## Organization Invitations

Organization invitations allow users to be invited to join an organization. Invitations typically involve sending an invite to a user via email, who can then accept with the uniquely generated code sent to them in an email and become a member of the organization.

## Examples

Adding a Member to an Existing Organization:

```graphql
mutation {
  createOrgMembership(
    input: {
      organizationID: "org1",
      userID: "user3",
      role: MEMBER
    }
  ) {
    orgMembership {
      id
      userID
      role
    }
  }
}
```

Updating Organization settings (update avatar):

```graphql
mutation UpdateOrganization($updateOrganizationId: ID!, $input: UpdateOrganizationInput!, $avatarFile: Upload) {
  updateOrganization(id: $updateOrganizationId, input: $input, avatarFile: $avatarFile) {
    organization {
      id
    }
  }
}
```
