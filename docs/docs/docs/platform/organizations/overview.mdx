# Overview

The `Organization` object represents a central entity within the system, encapsulating various resources, settings, and members. It serves as a container for managing access control, settings, and relationships with other entities.

## Permissions at an Organization Level

Permissions within an organization are managed through roles and specific permissions:

* Roles: Roles such as `owner`, `admin`, `member` define the level of access a user has within an organization.
* Permissions: Specific permissions like `can_view`, `can_edit`, `audit_log_viewer`, and `can_invite_members` are assigned to roles to control access to various resources and actions within the organization.

### Organization Membership

Organization membership involves associating users with an organization and assigning them roles. Membership details include:

* Roles: Roles assigned to members determine their access level and permissions within the organization.
* Membership Management: Members can be added, updated, or removed using mutations like `createOrgMembership`, `updateOrgMembership`, and `deleteOrgMembership`.

### Update Organization roles

Example:

```graphql
mutation UpdateUserRoleInOrg($updateOrgMemberId: ID!, $input: UpdateOrgMembershipInput!) {
  updateOrgMembership(id: $updateOrgMemberId, input: $input) {
    orgMembership {
      id
      role
      userID
      organizationID
    }
  }
}
```

## Organization Invitations

Organization invitations allow users to be invited to join an organization. Invitations typically involve sending an invite to a user via email, who can then accept with the uniquely generated code sent to them in an email and become a member of the organization.

## Examples

Adding a Member to an Existing Organization:

```graphql
mutation {
  createOrgMembership(
    input: {
      organizationID: "org1",
      userID: "user3",
      role: MEMBER
    }
  ) {
    orgMembership {
      id
      userID
      role
    }
  }
}
```

Updating Organization settings (update avatar):

```graphql
mutation UpdateOrganization($updateOrganizationId: ID!, $input: UpdateOrganizationInput!, $avatarFile: Upload) {
  updateOrganization(id: $updateOrganizationId, input: $input, avatarFile: $avatarFile) {
    organization {
      id
    }
  }
}
```
