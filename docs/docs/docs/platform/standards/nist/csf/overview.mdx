# Overview

NIST CSF is the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework which is a set of voluntary guidelines and best practices created by the U.S. government to help organizations manage and reduce their cybersecurity risks by providing a structured approach to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats; essentially acting as a framework for improving overall cybersecurity posture across different industries.

## Purpose

To provide a standardized way for organizations to assess and improve their cybersecurity posture by identifying potential risks and implementing appropriate security controls.

## Core functions

The framework is structured around five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These functions provide a high-level view of the lifecycle of managing cybersecurity risks.
