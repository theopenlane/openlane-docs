# Overview

[GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.

## Scope

GDPR applies to:

- **Data Controllers**: Organizations that determine the purposes and means of processing personal data.
- **Data Processors**: Organizations that process personal data on behalf of the controller.
- **Personal Data**: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

## Key Principles

- **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: Data processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data collected for specified, legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.
- **Data Minimization**: Data collected should be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed.
- **Accuracy**: Data must be accurate and kept up to date.
- **Storage Limitation**: Data should be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary.
- **Integrity and Confidentiality**: Data must be processed securely to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

## Rights of Data Subjects

- **Right to Access**: Individuals have the right to access their personal data and obtain information about how it is processed.
- **Right to Rectification**: Individuals can request correction of inaccurate personal data.
- **Right to Erasure**: Also known as the "right to be forgotten," individuals can request deletion of their personal data under certain conditions.
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: Individuals can request the restriction of processing their personal data under certain conditions.
- **Right to Data Portability**: Individuals can request the transfer of their personal data to another controller.
- **Right to Object**: Individuals can object to the processing of their personal data under certain conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: Appointment of a DPO is mandatory for certain organizations.
- **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)**: Conduct DPIAs for high-risk processing activities.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Notify the relevant supervisory authority and affected individuals of a data breach within 72 hours.
- **International Data Transfers**: Ensure adequate protection for data transferred outside the EU/EEA.

## Enforcement and Penalties
- **Supervisory Authorities**: Each EU member state has a supervisory authority to enforce GDPR.
- **Penalties**: Organizations can face fines up to â‚¬20 million or 4% of their global annual turnover, whichever is higher, for non-compliance.
