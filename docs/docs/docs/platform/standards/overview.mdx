# Overview

## Frameworks and Regulations

Well...  There are a lot.  Your organization likely uses some of these, but certainly not all. Executive leadership drives policy at a high level based on business objectives. Certain regulations are mandatory. For instance Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) for US publicly traded companies or General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to any organisation handling data from EU citizens.
