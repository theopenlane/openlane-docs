## Is SOC 2 mandatory?

No, a SOC 2 is not legally required by any organization. However, your customer may require you to obtain one in order to do business with you.

## Is SOC 2 a certification or an attestation?

There’s no such thing as SOC 2 certification. It is more accurate to call the process of gaining compliance a SOC 2 attestation. This is because SOC 2 audits are conducted by licensed CPAs based on standards set by the AICPA—but there’s no certifying body or official certification. Auditors provide an objective report on your security posture that lacks a pass or fail outcome.

## Who needs to comply with SOC 2?

SOC 2 compliance is not legally required for any organization. It’s completely voluntary for businesses to get and there are no fines or penalties for not having a SOC 2. This standard is commonly used by SaaS companies, organizations that provide business intelligence or analytics, and managed IT providers.‍


## Can you fail a SOC 2 audit?

You can’t technically "fail" a SOC 2 audit, as there’s no pass or fail system. Instead, the auditor provides an objective report on your security posture. If your controls or their execution don’t meet the required criteria, the report may include a “qualified opinion,” signaling areas that need improvement.
