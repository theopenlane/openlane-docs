# Taskfiles

All repositories throughout the Openlane Github organization heavily use [Taskfiles](https://taskfile.dev/) to assist with commonly used development tasks, including things like test commands, lint commands, and generate commands.

Setup [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) by following the
instructions and using one of the various convenient package managers or
installation scripts.

Once installed you can simply run `task` from anywhere in the tree of the repo to see all available commands, for example:

```shell
task
```
```shell
task: Available tasks for this project:
* precommit-full:         Lint the project against all files
* example:ent:            runs go generate against ent schema - see the entc.go file and generates the fga mock client
* example:generate:       a combination of the ent, graph, and gqlgen tasks which are required to fully generate the necessary graph, server, resolvers, client, etc.
* go:all:                 runs all go test and lint related tasks      (aliases: go)
* go:lint:                runs golangci-lint, the most annoying opinionated linter ever
* go:test:                runs and outputs results of created go tests
* go:tidy:                runs go mod tidy on the backend      (aliases: tidy)
